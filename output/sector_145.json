        "answer": "Sector 145, while enjoying premium connectivity, benefits from a slightly different pricing structure compared to fully commercialized zones like Sector 137 or established residential areas closer to Delhi. A key reason for the affordability is the higher supply of independent builder floors and low-rise apartments, which generally have lower maintenance overheads than large high-rise societies. Furthermore, many affordable house options here offer flexibility in construction style, allowing buyers to manage costs effectively while securing a great location near the Expressway."
