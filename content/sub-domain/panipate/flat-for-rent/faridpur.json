    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for rental flats in Faridpur",
        "answer": "Most landlords in Faridpur require a security deposit equivalent to one to three months’ rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear. It is crucial to have the exact amount and the conditions for refund clearly documented in your rental agreement to prevent future disputes regarding your refundable deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are rental agreements in Faridpur typically 11 months or 12 months long",
        "answer": "Standard residential rental agreements for flats in Faridpur are usually structured for 11 months. This duration is often preferred by landlords as it avoids mandatory registration under certain tenancy laws that apply to leases exceeding one year. While 11-month agreements are common, longer 12-month or multi-year leases can be negotiated, especially for corporate or long-term family rentals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I verify if a rental listing for a flat in Faridpur is genuine",
        "answer": "To verify authenticity, always insist on a physical viewing of the flat and request to see the current electricity and utility bills to confirm the landlord’s ownership details match the deed papers. Using a reputable platform like ours ensures pre-verification, but independent confirmation during the viewing is always recommended when securing flats for rent in Faridpur."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utilities are usually included in the rent price for flats in Faridpur",
        "answer": "In most conventional rental flats in Faridpur, the monthly rent covers the property charge only. Tenants are typically responsible for their own utility consumption, including electricity, water charges, gas connection, and internet services. Serviced apartments are the exception where utilities might be fully included in the monthly fee. Always confirm which specific costs are your responsibility before signing the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it easy to find furnished rental apartments in central Faridpur",
        "answer": "While unfurnished and semi-furnished flats are more common, fully furnished rental apartments are increasingly available, particularly in newer complexes and central areas like Mujib Road. Furnished flats command a higher rent but offer convenience, especially for short-term stays or tenants who are new to the city and wish to avoid the hassle of purchasing furniture."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average rent prices for a 2 BHK flat in a good locality in Faridpur",
        "answer": "Average rental prices for a standard 2 BHK flat in a desirable neighborhood of Faridpur generally range from BDT 15,000 to BDT 25,000 per month, depending heavily on the building age, maintenance level, and proximity to major commercial hubs. Premium complexes with luxury amenities may exceed this range, so it is important to research specific localities before setting your budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and maintenance in a rented flat",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is responsible for minor repairs arising from daily use, such as changing lightbulbs or fixing small plumbing issues caused by negligence. The landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, electrical wiring faults, and issues related to building infrastructure. The lease agreement must clearly delineate the boundary between tenant and landlord maintenance responsibilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rental price for flats in Faridpur",
        "answer": "Yes, rental prices are often negotiable, particularly during the off-peak season or if you are committing to a long-term lease of 12 months or more. Preparedness is key having documents ready and demonstrating reliability can give you leverage. Negotiation success depends largely on the market demand for that specific flat and the landlord’s urgency to rent the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to prepare before applying for a flat rental",
        "answer": "Prospective tenants should prepare copies of national ID cards or passports, proof of employment or student status, and recent salary slips or bank statements demonstrating financial stability. Landlords usually require these documents to conduct background checks and confirm your ability to meet the monthly rental payments for the chosen flat in Faridpur."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much notice is required when terminating a rental agreement early",
        "answer": "Standard rental agreements in Faridpur typically require a notice period of 30 to 60 days if either party wishes to terminate the contract early, though this should be explicitly stated in the lease. If you terminate without proper notice, you may forfeit part or all of your security deposit, so always adhere strictly to the terms outlined in your signed agreement."
