    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rate of capital appreciation for a shop in Model Town Panipat",
        "answer": "Commercial properties in prime Model Town areas typically see steady capital appreciation, often ranging between 6 to 10 percent annually, dependent on micro-location and infrastructure development. Shops situated on the main arteries or near newly established residential clusters generally experience the highest growth trajectory due to increasing demand and limited supply of high-quality commercial space."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are commercial properties in Model Town RERA registered and why is this important",
        "answer": "While RERA primarily governs residential projects, commercial projects exceeding a certain size or those that are newly developed may fall under its jurisdiction. It is crucial to check the RERA status as registration provides a layer of buyer protection, ensures timely delivery, and guarantees transparency in area measurement and promised amenities, making your investment safer."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to legally purchase a Shop For Sale in Model Town",
        "answer": "Essential legal documentation includes the Sale Deed, Mother Deed chain, Non-Encumbrance Certificate, mutation papers, property tax receipts, and the Occupancy or Completion Certificate if the shop is in a new complex. For older properties, ensuring all conversion and approval documents for commercial use are present is vital to prevent future legal issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors should I consider when assessing the rental potential of a shop location",
        "answer": "The rental potential of a shop hinges heavily on foot traffic, visibility, accessibility, and the presence of complementary businesses. Shops near banks, branded outlets, or key residential gates command higher rent. Analyze the current tenant profile and ensure the shop faces the main road or high-density pedestrian flow for maximum returns."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can foreigners or NRIs legally buy commercial property in Model Town Panipat",
        "answer": "Yes, Non-Resident Indians NRIs and Persons of Indian Origin PIOs can legally purchase commercial immovable property in India, including shops in Model Town, subject to compliance with FEMA guidelines. Foreign nationals require specific RBI approval, though commercial real estate investment is generally permitted under specific conditions and repatriation restrictions may apply."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common extra costs associated with buying a commercial shop beyond the listing price",
        "answer": "Buyers must factor in stamp duty, registration fees which are substantial for commercial transactions, brokerage fees typically 1 to 2 percent, legal consultation charges, and potential municipal development charges or conversion fees if the shop use is being changed. Always budget an additional 7 to 10 percent above the base property cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Model Town a better investment for shops than other sectors in Panipat like Sector 13 or 25",
        "answer": "Model Town is typically considered a premium, established market with high stability and affluent clientele, often yielding steady, high rents. While sectors like 13 and 25 offer newer infrastructure and potentially lower entry costs, Model Town provides the reputation and proven commercial success required for long-term secure investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify if a commercial shop is approved for specific business usage like a restaurant or clinic",
        "answer": "You must check the property's Master Plan land use and the specific building's Occupancy Certificate issued by the local municipal corporation. These documents specify the approved usage, such as retail, office, or food service. Using a shop for an unapproved purpose can lead to significant penalties and eventual closure by authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of financing options are available for purchasing commercial property in Model Town",
        "answer": "Most major banks offer commercial property loans which typically cover 50 to 70 percent of the property value. These loans have different interest rates and shorter repayment tenures compared to residential home loans. We can connect you with specialized lending partners who understand the nuances of the Panipat commercial market."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance charges are typical for a shop located within a modern commercial complex",
        "answer": "Shops within commercial complexes typically incur monthly maintenance charges to cover shared services like security, common area lighting, lift operations, generator backup, and waste management. These fees are calculated based on the square footage of the shop and are essential for maintaining the building's professional appeal and functionality."
