    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What types of commercial property are most in demand in Sector 13 and 17 Panipat",
        "answer": "The highest demand is currently observed for street-facing ground-floor retail shops and small to mid-sized office spaces suitable for professional consulting firms and local franchises. In Sector 13 high visibility showrooms are always popular due to the existing high footfall. In Sector 17 pre-leased office units are highly sought after by institutional investors looking for immediate returns. We advise focusing on properties near main road junctions or existing market clusters to ensure maximum tenant interest and stable rental income potential."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental yield I can expect from commercial property in these sectors",
        "answer": "Rental yields for premium commercial property in Sector 13 and 17 Panipat generally range between 55 percent to 75 percent annually depending heavily on the property type location and tenant profile. Ground floor retail spaces typically offer the highest yields due to intense competition among tenants for prime spots.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 17 or Sector 13 a better long-term investment choice for commercial real estate",
        "answer": "Both sectors offer strong long-term investment prospects but for different reasons. Sector 13 is often considered safer due to its established market and existing infrastructure guaranteeing steady returns and liquidity. Sector 17 while slightly newer offers higher growth potential due to ongoing infrastructural development and modernization making it ideal for investors seeking maximum capital appreciation over a 5 to 10-year horizon. We recommend diversifying your commercial portfolio across both sectors if possible to balance stability and aggressive growth."
