This duality makes it an ideal investment location as you benefit from existing infrastructure stability while capitalizing on future projected price appreciation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the key zoning regulations for commercial plots in Virat Nagar Panipat",
        "answer": "Zoning regulations typically mandate specific permissible usage types, ground coverage limits, and Floor Area Ratio FAR restrictions.
