    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration when using your To Let service in Ashok Vihar Colony Panipat",
        "answer": "The standard rental agreement term in Ashok Vihar Colony is typically 11 months, which is commonly renewable. This duration balances stability for the tenant with flexibility for the landlord, avoiding lengthy registration processes often required for 12-month or longer leases. However, we can facilitate longer leases if both parties mutually agree and are prepared for the necessary registration formalities required under Haryana rental laws."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much is the security deposit for rental properties in Ashok Vihar Colony",
        "answer": "Security deposits usually equate to two months rent for residential properties in Ashok Vihar Colony. For commercial spaces, this amount might be slightly higher, often ranging from three to six months rent, depending on the properties location and fit-out costs. This deposit is refundable upon successful completion of the lease and satisfactory property handover, factoring in any damages beyond normal wear and tear."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance in a rented property",
        "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs and external maintenance related to the building structure, plumbing, or electrical wiring. The tenant is typically responsible for day-to-day minor maintenance, appliance upkeep, and ensuring the cleanliness of the property. Specific responsibilities are clearly outlined in the rental agreement facilitated by our To Let service."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a brokerage fee to use the To Let Service as a tenant",
        "answer": "Yes, our professional To Let service typically charges a standard brokerage fee equivalent to one months rent from the tenant upon successful finalization of the lease agreement. This fee covers our extensive services including property sourcing, verification, viewing coordination, and full documentation support throughout the rental process in Ashok Vihar Colony Panipat."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can your To Let Service help me find a property in Ashok Vihar Colony",
        "answer": "The speed of finding a suitable rental property depends on your specific requirements and market availability. However, because our listings are pre-verified and curated, many clients secure a property match within 3 to 7 working days. The viewing and documentation process can then be completed within another week, ensuring a fast turnaround time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to break the lease agreement early",
        "answer": "Breaking a lease early usually requires providing a notice period, typically 30 to 60 days, as specified in the rental contract. The consequences often involve the forfeiture of the security deposit or an obligation to pay rent until a replacement tenant is found. Our team works to mediate fair solutions, but contractual terms must be respected."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the listed rents negotiable in Ashok Vihar Colony Panipat",
        "answer": "Yes, rent negotiation is a standard part of the process.

We aim to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement."

        "answer": "Absolutely. We maintain a robust inventory of properties, including semi-furnished and fully furnished apartments and houses throughout Ashok Vihar Colony. Furnished units typically command a higher rental price but offer the convenience of immediate move-in without the logistics of purchasing furniture."

        "question": "As a landlord, how do you handle rent collection and defaults",
        "answer": "For landlords opting for our property management package, we handle monthly rent collection and provide timely reports. In the event of a default, we follow a strict legal protocol beginning with formal notices and escalation, ensuring your interests are protected legally and efficiently under the rental law framework."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need police verification when moving into a rental property in Ashok Vihar",
        "answer": "Yes, police verification of tenants is a mandatory requirement by the local authorities in Panipat for all rental properties.
