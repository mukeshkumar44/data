    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a residential rental agreement in Sector 12 Huda Panipat",
        "answer": "Generally, residential rental agreements facilitated through our To Let Service in Sector 12 Huda include a standard 11-month lease with a mandatory lock-in period often set at the first six months. This means neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the agreement during this initial six-month period without facing penalties usually equivalent to one or two months of rent. We always negotiate the most flexible terms possible ensuring both parties have reasonable stability and exit clauses clearly documented within the agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is standard when renting an apartment in Sector 12 Huda",
        "answer": "The standard practice in Sector 12 Huda for residential rentals is a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. For premium properties or commercial leases this might extend to three months rent depending on the landlord's preference and the perceived risk level. This deposit is refundable upon termination of the lease provided the property is returned in good condition barring normal wear and tear. Our service ensures the deposit terms are transparent and legally sound."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges usually included in the rent for properties in Sector 12 Huda",
        "answer": "It depends entirely on the type of property. For apartments within larger society complexes maintenance charges covering shared amenities like lift operation common area cleaning and security are often separate from the base rent and payable directly to the Residents Welfare Association RWA. If you are renting an independent floor or house in Sector 12 Huda basic structural maintenance is usually the landlord's responsibility while day-to-day upkeep falls to the tenant. We clarify all maintenance cost divisions before the contract is finalized."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required from a tenant to finalize a rental agreement through your service",
        "answer": "To proceed with renting a property using our professional To Let Service in Sector 12 Huda Huda Panipat tenants must provide valid photo identification such as an Aadhaar Card or Passport along with proof of current employment or student status if applicable.

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you handle the police verification process for new tenants in Sector 12 Panipat",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet a portion of my rented property in Sector 12 Huda Panipat",
        "answer": "Generally, subletting is strictly prohibited unless expressly permitted in writing by the landlord within the original lease agreement. Standard rental contracts facilitated by our To Let Service clearly state that the premises are for the exclusive use of the named tenant and their immediate family or business operations. Any attempt to sublet without explicit consent constitutes a breach of contract and could lead to immediate eviction and forfeiture of the security deposit."

      },

        "question": "What happens if a dispute arises between the tenant and landlord during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "Our To Let Service includes a mediation role for the duration of the initial lease term. If a dispute arises regarding maintenance rent payment schedules or breach of contract we act as a neutral third party to facilitate communication and seek an amicable resolution based on the terms stipulated in the original registered agreement. This support is a key benefit of using our professional services."
      },

We encourage clients with pets to inform us immediately so we can narrow the search to these specific properties. Additional pet deposits or stricter cleaning clauses may apply to these specialized rentals."
