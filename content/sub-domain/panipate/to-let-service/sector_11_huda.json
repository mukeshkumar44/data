    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit amount required for rental properties in Sector 11 Huda",
        "answer": "In Sector 11 Panipat, the standard security deposit usually ranges from one to two months' worth of monthly rent, depending on the property type and the landlord's policy. For high-end residential units or commercial spaces, this might occasionally extend to three months. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there are no damages beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills have been settled by the tenant. We ensure these terms are clearly stipulated in the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it usually take to find a reliable tenant through your To Let Service in Sector 11",
        "answer": "The time frame is dependent on accurate pricing and property condition. For well-maintained properties priced according to current Sector 11 Huda market rates, we typically secure a verified tenant within two to four weeks. Our aggressive marketing strategies, including premium listings and targeted outreach, significantly reduce vacancy periods compared to self-managed listings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility connections included in the rent for properties in Sector 11 Panipat",
        "answer": "Generally, rent covers the cost of the property space itself, while utilities such as electricity, water, gas, and internet are the tenant's responsibility and are paid directly by the tenant based on consumption. In rare cases, minor utilities like water might be included in a flat monthly service charge, but this is always clearly detailed in the lease agreement provided by our To Let Service."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for property maintenance and minor repairs during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "Typically, the landlord is responsible for structural repairs, major maintenance, and issues related to plumbing and electrical systems unless the damage is caused by the tenant's negligence. Minor repairs, like replacing lightbulbs or fixing minor leaks, often fall under the tenant's responsibility. The specific division of maintenance responsibilities is always outlined explicitly in the rental contract managed by our team."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required from a tenant before finalising a rental agreement in Sector 11 Huda",

Foreign nationals require valid visa and passport copies. Our To Let Service ensures all documentation complies with regulatory requirements for a secure tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet my apartment if I use your To Let Service in Sector 11 Panipat",
        "answer": "Standard lease agreements generally prohibit subletting without the explicit prior written consent of the landlord. Subletting clauses are strict because it introduces an unverified third party to the property. If you need to break your lease, we advise discussing early termination clauses with our team rather than attempting unauthorised subletting."
      },

        "question": "How does your service ensure legal compliance with Haryana rental laws",

If the default persists, we initiate necessary legal procedures as per the lease agreement and local laws.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific notice periods required for lease termination by either the landlord or tenant",

We clearly define the notice period clauses in every lease facilitated by our Sector 11 Huda To Let Service."
