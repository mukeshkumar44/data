    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a residential rental agreement in Tehsil Camp",
        "answer": "While rental agreements in Panipat typically run for 11 months, many residential leases incorporate a 6-month lock-in period. This means neither the landlord nor the tenant can terminate the agreement during the initial six months without incurring a penalty, usually equivalent to one or two months' rent. However, we negotiate these terms based on the landlord's preference and the tenant's commitment, ensuring the final lease is fair and clearly understood by both parties before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does your To Let service verify potential tenants for properties in Tehsil Camp",
        "answer": "Our verification process is comprehensive and multi-layered. It includes mandatory submission of Aadhar card and PAN card copies, employment verification through salary slips or employer contact, previous landlord references, and a thorough police verification check as mandated by local authorities in Panipat. This rigorous screening minimizes risk for landlords and ensures only reliable tenants occupy the premises."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and routine maintenance in a rented flat",
        "answer": "Generally, the responsibility for maintenance is clearly defined in the lease agreement. Tenants are typically responsible for minor running repairs and wear and tear items such as replacing light bulbs, maintaining cleanliness, and small plumbing issues. The landlord remains responsible for major structural repairs, electrical wiring issues, waterproofing, and structural integrity of the property. Our managed service ensures clear accountability and quick action when maintenance is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is your service charge for finding a tenant for my Tehsil Camp property",
        "answer": "Our service charge is competitive and generally equivalent to one month's gross rent for securing a qualified, verified tenant and finalizing the 11-month lease agreement. This fee covers all our marketing costs, property visits, tenant verification expenses, and drafting the legally sound rental deed. We ensure transparent invoicing with no additional hidden costs during the process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I list a vacant commercial plot for lease using your To Let service",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We specialize in both residential and commercial listings, including vacant commercial plots and land parcels in and around Tehsil Camp Panipat. We help commercial landlords identify suitable lessees for uses such as temporary parking, storage yards, or setup sites for businesses, ensuring the lease terms align with Panipat's commercial zoning regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you handle disputes between landlords and tenants under your management",
        "answer": "As a neutral third party, our primary goal is mediation and resolution. We first review the terms of the signed lease agreement, which serves as the guiding document. We facilitate respectful dialogue between the parties to reach an amicable solution regarding rent payment delays, maintenance disagreements, or notice period issues, striving to avoid formal legal proceedings wherever possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it mandatory to register the rental agreement in Panipat and do you assist with this",
        "answer": "For rental agreements exceeding 11 months, registration is legally mandatory in Haryana. While 11-month leases are generally notarized, registration provides stronger legal backing. We fully assist with the entire registration process, including coordinating appointments at the Sub-Registrar’s office and ensuring the payment of appropriate stamp duty and registration fees, making the process effortless for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I expect to rent out my well-maintained flat in Tehsil Camp",
        "answer": "The speed of rental depends on accurate pricing and property condition. For a competitively priced, well-maintained residential property in a good location within Tehsil Camp, the typical time from listing to securing a verified tenant is often between 15 and 45 days. Our aggressive digital marketing and extensive database of pre-qualified tenants help significantly reduce this timeline."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer property management services beyond just finding a tenant",
        "answer": "Yes, our comprehensive property management package is highly popular among absentee landlords. This service includes rent collection management, monthly or quarterly property inspections, handling all tenant queries, coordinating timely repairs and maintenance, and providing detailed financial statements, offering true passive income from your Tehsil Camp investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do tenants need to submit when applying for a rental property",
        "answer": "Prospective tenants are typically required to submit copies of their identity proof such as Aadhar Card and PAN Card, current address proof, proof of employment or business ownership, bank statements for the last three months, and often a letter of reference from their previous landlord or current employer. These documents ensure compliance and establish credibility during the application review process."
