      {
        "question": "What is the typical management fee for To Let Service in Sector 13 Panipat",
        "answer": "Our management fee is highly competitive and structured as a small percentage of the collected monthly rent. This fee covers all core services including marketing, tenant screening, rent collection, and maintenance coordination. We believe in performance-based fees, meaning we only get paid when your property is generating income. Specific rates depend on the property type and the level of service required, and we are happy to provide a transparent breakdown during your initial consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can you find a suitable tenant for my property in Sector 13",
        "answer": "Tenant placement speed depends on market conditions, property condition, and rental price. However, thanks to our aggressive marketing strategies and extensive network, our average time-to-rent in Sector 13 is significantly lower than self-management. We aim to secure a quality tenant within 15 to 30 days after listing, provided the property is market-ready and competitively priced according to our valuation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you handle the legal formalities like police verification and lease registration",
        "answer": "Absolutely yes. Handling legal compliance is a critical component of our comprehensive To Let Service in Sector 13 Panipat. We ensure that all tenants complete necessary police verification as mandated by local authorities. Furthermore, we manage the drafting and registration of the rental agreement, ensuring all documents adhere to local laws and protect the landlord’s interests effectively."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if a tenant causes damage to my property during the lease period",
        "answer": "Our process minimizes this risk through careful tenant selection and detailed move-in inspections. If damage occurs beyond standard wear and tear, the cost of repairs is deducted from the tenant’s security deposit. We document all damages meticulously during the move-out inspection and coordinate the necessary repairs using the funds held, ensuring your property is restored quickly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I still access my property while it is being managed by your To Let Service",
        "answer": "Yes, while we handle the day-to-day management, you remain the property owner. Any entry into the property is governed by the lease agreement, typically requiring written notice to the tenant, except in emergencies. We coordinate all necessary access for routine maintenance or inspections, ensuring minimal disruption to the tenant and clear communication with you."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you determine the correct security deposit amount for rental homes",
        "answer": "The standard practice in Sector 13 Panipat is typically one to two months’ rent as a security deposit. We recommend an appropriate amount based on the property's value, furnishings, and market standards. This deposit is held to cover unpaid rent, utilities, or property damage beyond normal wear and tear upon the tenant’s departure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is your process for handling tenant late payments or evictions",
        "answer": "We enforce strict lease terms regarding payment dates. For late payments, we follow a clear, documented procedure involving late fee assessments and formal notices as permitted by law. In rare cases where eviction is necessary, our legal team coordinates the process efficiently, minimizing financial loss and ensuring compliance with all local tenancy regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for the handover or agreement signing process",
