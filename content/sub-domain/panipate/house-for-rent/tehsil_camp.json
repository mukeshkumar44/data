    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a rental house in Tehsil Camp",
        "answer": "The standard practice for rental properties in Tehsil Camp Panipat is to require a security deposit equivalent to one or two months’ rent.

Always clarify the refund timeline and conditions directly with the property owner or agent before signing the lease agreement for your House For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses or builder floors more common for rent in this area",
        "answer": "Both independent houses and builder floors are widely available in Tehsil Camp. Builder floors, which typically occupy a single level of a multi-story independent building, often offer modern amenities and standardized layouts. Independent houses provide more autonomy and sometimes a private outdoor space. Your choice depends primarily on your privacy needs, budget, and the specific size requirements of your family."
      },

        "question": "What are the common lease durations for rental properties in Tehsil Camp Panipat",

      },
