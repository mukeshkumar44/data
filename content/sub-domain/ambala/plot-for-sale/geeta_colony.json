        "question": "What is the typical price range for a residential plot for sale in Geeta Colony",
        "answer": "The price of a plot in Geeta Colony varies significantly based on several factors including the size of the land, its exact location within the colony, road width access, and whether it is a corner plot or facing a park. Smaller 4 Marla plots may start at an accessible range while premium, larger plots along main roads or in fully developed blocks command significantly higher rates.

Our legal team assists in compiling and verifying every single required document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Geeta Colony considered a good area for property investment appreciation",
        "answer": "Yes, Geeta Colony is generally considered a highly desirable location for investment primarily due to its central location, robust social infrastructure, and excellent connectivity to key business districts.

      },
      {
        "question": "What plot sizes are most suitable for construction in Geeta Colony",

If you are planning a large duplex, a multi-story building, or need ample parking and green space, 10 Marla or larger plots provide the flexibility required.

It is critical to confirm the specific zoning of the plot with municipal plans before planning any construction activities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the registration process typically take for a plot purchase",
        "answer": "Once all legal due diligence is completed and the sale agreement is signed, the registration process typically takes between 10 to 15 working days.
