    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the common types of residential properties available in Tagore Garden for purchase",
        "answer": "Tagore Garden offers a mix of residential formats catering to various budgetary requirements and family sizes. The most common properties include independent houses, which range from older construction with renovation potential to modern luxury bungalows. Additionally, you will find numerous builder floors, typically structured as 2 BHK, 3 BHK, or 4 BHK units, offering contemporary amenities and secure living. The availability often depends on the plot size, with smaller plots hosting builder floors and larger plots supporting multi-story independent homes. Our listings include verified options across all these property types."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Tagore Garden a good location for long-term real estate investment appreciation",
        "answer": "Yes, Tagore Garden is consistently viewed as a prime residential area in West Delhi, demonstrating strong long-term appreciation potential. Its established infrastructure, excellent metro connectivity via the Blue Line, proximity to major commercial hubs like Rajouri Garden, and easy access to schools and hospitals contribute significantly to its high demand. Properties here hold their value well because the area is largely developed, limiting new supply and ensuring steady demand from both end-users and investors seeking a stable asset."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for an independent House For Sale in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "The price range is highly variable, depending heavily on the plot size, the age of construction, the quality of internal finishes, and whether it is a Kothi or a builder floor unit. For a typical 3 BHK builder floor, prices can start from approximately INR 70 Lacs to INR 1.5 Crore. Large independent houses on 8 Marla or larger plots can easily range from INR 4 Crore up to INR 15 Crore or more for a premium, newly constructed luxury kothi. We recommend discussing your budget with our specialists for the most accurate current market assessment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is proximity to the Tagore Garden Metro Station when buying a house",
        "answer": "Proximity to the Tagore Garden Metro Station is a major factor influencing property value and desirability in the area. Houses within a 10 to 15-minute walking distance command a premium due to the ease of commute across Delhi NCR. Even for those who primarily drive, being near the station adds liquidity to the asset, making it easier to rent out or sell in the future. We highlight metro connectivity details for all our House For Sale in Tagore Garden listings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific documentation requirements unique to properties in this locality",
        "answer": "While standard documentation requirements like Sale Deed, Mother Deed, and Encumbrance Certificate apply, buyers should pay close attention to the authenticity of construction plans and municipal clearances in Tagore Garden, especially for older independent houses or newly developed builder floors. We ensure that all properties listed comply fully with local Delhi Development Authority DDA and Municipal Corporation of Delhi MCD regulations, providing clear title guarantees for every transaction we facilitate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Non-Resident Indians NRI purchase independent houses in Tagore Garden easily",

The process involves standard legal procedures, and NRIs must adhere to Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA regulations. We specialize in assisting NRI clients, providing comprehensive support regarding remittances, documentation, power of attorney execution, and property management post-purchase, ensuring a smooth and compliant acquisition process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What amenities should I look for when buying a modern builder floor in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "Modern builder floors in Tagore Garden often feature essential luxury and security amenities. Key features to prioritize include dedicated stilt or basement parking, elevator access, 24/7 power backup, modular kitchens, high-quality sanitary fittings, and secure gated entries. For premium units, look for features such as smart home automation integration and high-end imported marble flooring, all of which enhance the living experience and resale value of the house."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical age profile of houses available for sale in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "Tagore Garden is an established neighborhood, so the age profile is varied. You will find older independent houses, often 30 to 40 years old, which are excellent for buyers looking for renovation projects or larger land parcels. Simultaneously, there is a strong presence of new construction, particularly modern builder floors and newly reconstructed independent houses built within the last five to ten years, offering contemporary design and structure. Our listings clearly indicate the age and renovation status of the house."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does connectivity and infrastructure impact the choice of house in this area",
        "answer": "Excellent connectivity is a core strength of Tagore Garden. Beyond the Metro, the area offers wide main roads, easy access to Ring Road, and proximity to major markets. Buyers should prioritize houses located on wider lanes, which offer better access and less traffic congestion. Robust infrastructure including reliable water supply and functional drainage systems is also standardized, but we verify the maintenance status for every House For Sale we recommend."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I consider buying a ready-to-move house or a new under-construction builder floor",
        "answer": "Both options have merits. A ready-to-move house in Tagore Garden offers immediate possession and eliminates construction risk, ideal if you need to relocate quickly. New under-construction builder floors often allow for customization of fittings and may involve lower upfront capital, but they carry potential risks related to completion timelines or quality issues. Our advice depends entirely on your risk tolerance, time frame, and financial liquidity, and we provide listings for both categories."
