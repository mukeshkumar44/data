    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What specific legal documents should I verify when buying a plot in Old Town Ambala",
        "answer": "Always demand to see the registered Sale Deed or conveyance deed, the mutation documents, the Jamabandi or land record extract, and the non-encumbrance certificate (EC) for the last 13 years. In Old Town, checking the sanctioned layout plan from the local municipal authority is crucial to ensure the plot is not encroaching on public land. A reputable Property Dealer in Old Town will provide all these documents upfront for meticulous review and verification."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I determine the actual market price of land in Old Town given its historical nature",
        "answer": "Property values in Old Town are highly variable based on street width, proximity to the main bazaar, and access to essential infrastructure like the railway line or major roads. We use recent sale deed data and compare similar transactions within a 500-meter radius to establish a fair and accurate valuation rather than relying solely on government circle rates, ensuring you pay a true market value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any zoning restrictions I should be aware of for plots in Old Town Ambala",
        "answer": "Yes, many parts of Old Town are designated for specific uses residential, commercial, or mixed-use. It is imperative to verify the land use classification before purchase, especially if you plan any commercial activity. Your Property Dealer in Old Town will confirm that your intended construction aligns perfectly with the municipal zoning laws and obtain necessary clearances for your peace of mind."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard payment schedule when purchasing a plot through a dealer in Ambala",
        "answer": "Typically, a token amount (earnest money) secures the deal, followed by 10-20% payment upon signing the Agreement to Sell. The remaining amount is usually transferred within 30 to 60 days upon full legal diligence and final registration. We ensure all payment milestones are clearly documented and legally binding for both parties involved."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the property registration process usually take in the Old Town sub-registrar office",
        "answer": "If all documents are prepared correctly and verified in advance by your property dealer, the actual registration appointment takes less than an hour. However, the preparation, clearance of dues, and securing the necessary No Objection Certificates (NOCs) might take between 10 to 30 working days depending on the complexity of the title history and governmental approval timelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I purchase land in Old Town if I am not a resident of Haryana or Ambala",
        "answer": "Absolutely, yes. There are generally no restrictions for Indian citizens purchasing residential land in Ambala, Haryana.

      },
      {
        "question": "What role does the Property Dealer play in resolving title disputes or boundary issues",
        "answer": "A professional Property Dealer in Old Town acts as your advocate, conducting detailed due diligence to identify potential disputes before the sale. If boundary clarification is needed, we arrange for official land demarcation (Musavi) and coordinate with land surveyors to ensure clear, undisputed physical possession of the plot you are purchasing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there financing options available for purchasing plots in the Old Town area",
        "answer": "Yes, many nationalized and private banks offer financing for residential plot purchases, although the loan-to-value ratio is often lower than for built properties due to valuation risks. We have established relationships with local bank managers who understand the Old Town market and can expedite your plot loan approval process efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Marla and square yards in the Old Town context",
        "answer": "While both units are used, Marla is the prevalent local unit in Ambala. 1 Marla is generally equivalent to 25 square yards. A standard 8 Marla plot is 200 square yards. Your Property Dealer in Old Town ensures all listing sizes are clearly stated and verified against official measurements for complete accuracy and transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is using a local Property Dealer crucial specifically in Old Town Ambala",
        "answer": "Old Town contains heritage properties and dense, old infrastructure, making title verification challenging.
