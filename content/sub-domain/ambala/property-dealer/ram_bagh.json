      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify the legal title and ownership of a plot in Ram Bagh",
        "answer": "Verifying the legal title is paramount. As your Property Dealer, we conduct thorough due diligence, which includes checking the registered sale deed, examining the chain of ownership history, obtaining a non-encumbrance certificate from the sub-registrar’s office, and confirming current property tax receipts. We ensure the land is free from any litigation or third-party claims before you finalize the purchase agreement, offering complete transparency."

We advise checking the current Master Plan for specific plot usage."

Therefore, a 4 Marla plot would be approximately 100 square yards or 900 square feet, and a 6 Marla plot would be 150 square yards or 1350 square feet. We always provide the exact dimensions and total area in all required units to avoid any confusion during measurement and construction planning."
