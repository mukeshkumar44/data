        "question": "Is it better to invest in a flat or a plot near Manav Chowk for long-term growth",
        "answer": "Both options offer different benefits. Plots generally provide higher capital appreciation because land supply is finite especially near prime areas like Manav Chowk and you retain full control over development.

If you seek immediate returns and minimal maintenance a flat is better. We provide customized investment strategies based on your financial horizon."

If the property documents are clean and the buyer is securing a home loan the process can take anywhere from 45 to 90 days. For outright cash purchases with clear titles the transaction can be finalized in as little as 30 days.
