    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What documentation should I verify before finalizing a plot purchase in Balana",
        "answer": "It is absolutely vital to verify the Title Deed and its chain of ownership, ensuring the seller has a clear, marketable title. You must also check the Mutation Record (Intkal) to confirm the property is correctly recorded in the government revenue records under the seller’s name. Other crucial documents include the Jamabandi (Record of Rights), NOCs if required by the local development authority, and checking for any lien or mortgage certificates. Our role as your Property Dealer in Balana is to provide a comprehensive due diligence report confirming all these documents are valid and legally sound."

      {
        "question": "How is the pricing of residential plots determined in different sectors of Balana Ambala",
        "answer": "Plot pricing in Balana is influenced by several factors proximity to main roads such as the Ambala-Chandigarh highway, access to essential utilities like water and sewage lines, the overall development status of the specific sector, and the size and orientation of the plot. Corner plots or those facing parks often command a premium. Our expert valuation team uses recent comparable sales data within Balana and current market trends to provide you with the most accurate and justified price assessment."

        "question": "Are there specific building regulations or construction limits for plots in Balana Ambala",

We ensure that any plot you purchase is suitable for your intended construction and help you understand the limits before you start planning your architecture."

        "question": "What is the typical brokerage fee structure when using a Property Dealer in Balana",

      {
        "question": "How long does the property registration process usually take in Ambala",
        "answer": "Once the sale agreement is signed and the full consideration amount is transferred, the actual registration of the conveyance deed at the Sub-Registrar office in Ambala typically takes one to three days.

        "answer": "Stamp Duty is a mandatory tax paid to the state government upon the transfer of property ownership. It validates the legal documentation. In Ambala, the stamp duty rate varies but is typically a percentage of the higher value between the circle rate (government fixed rate) and the actual transaction value. Our team calculates the exact stamp duty and registration fees payable for your Balana property to ensure accurate budgeting."
