    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What types of properties does your Property Dealer service offer in Ghel Ambala",
        "answer": "As the primary property dealer in Ghel Ambala, we specialize extensively in verified residential plots ranging from 4 Marla up to 20 Marla, ideal for independent house construction. We also maintain a strong inventory of ready-to-move independent houses, often customized villas, and significant listings for agricultural land parcels suitable for farmhouses or future conversion, subject to zoning regulations. Furthermore, we handle strategic commercial plots located near main roads and market areas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Ghel considered a good area for long-term real estate investment now",
        "answer": "Yes, Ghel is currently rated as an excellent location for long-term investment, primarily due to its proximity to Ambala City and Ambala Cantt, which provides essential connectivity without the high price congestion. The local government has focused development efforts on improving road infrastructure and utilities in the Ghel periphery, suggesting strong capital appreciation is imminent over the next three to seven years, making now a highly opportune time to buy plots."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical legal process for registering a residential plot in Ghel",
        "answer": "The legal process is streamlined when working with a verified dealer. It typically involves confirming the seller's title deeds, drafting the Sale Agreement, obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) if required, paying the applicable stamp duty based on current circle rates in Ghel Ambala, and finally, executing the registration deed at the Sub-Registrar’s office. We manage all these steps ensuring zero compliance errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Khasra and Khatauni when dealing with Ghel land records",
        "answer": "Khasra is a crucial number used in Ghel land records that represents a specific parcel of land, similar to a plot number on a village map. Khatauni, conversely, is a document that lists the land holdings of a family or a group of shared owners within a village, documenting their total owned parcels identified by multiple Khasra numbers. Understanding both is essential for clear title verification, especially for agricultural land."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify the authenticity of a property title deed in Ghel Ambala",
        "answer": "Authenticity verification involves several layers. Firstly, we check the ownership chain recorded at the Patwari or Tehsildar office. Secondly, we cross-reference this with revenue records and check for any outstanding loans or legal disputes registered with local courts. We also ensure the property boundaries match the map, often utilizing land surveyors for precise measurement verification before any payment is made."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific restrictions on construction or height limitations in Ghel",
        "answer": "Construction in Ghel, particularly in notified residential areas, is governed by the municipal development authority regulations of Ambala. There are set Floor Area Ratios (FAR) and height restrictions, usually limiting residential structures to G+2 or G+3 floors depending on the specific zone. Our team provides the most recent building bylaws specific to the area of your purchased plot to ensure full compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What costs are involved besides the property price when buying a plot in Ghel",
        "answer": "Besides the negotiated sale price, buyers must account for several other mandatory costs. These primarily include Stamp Duty which is a percentage of the sale value or circle rate, whichever is higher, Registration Fees, legal consultation fees for due diligence, and our broker service charges. We provide a full cost breakdown upfront so there are absolutely no financial surprises."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get home loan financing easily for plots located in Ghel Ambala",
        "answer": "Yes, financing is generally available, but the ease depends on the plot’s location status. Fully developed residential plots within approved colonies near Ghel are easily financed by major banks. However, if the plot is agricultural land or located in a yet-to-be-approved area, securing financing can be more challenging. We partner with reliable financial institutions that specialize in Ghel property loans."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the average process take from selection to registration in Ghel",
        "answer": "If all documentation is clear and the buyer has the funds ready, the process can be remarkably efficient. On average, from the moment an offer is accepted to the final registration of the deed, the process typically takes between four to six weeks. This timeframe accounts for all necessary due diligence, stamp duty payment, and scheduling the sub-registrar appointment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you assist with selling commercial or agricultural land holdings in Ghel",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We are not just a leading buyer's agent; we are experts at listing and selling property in Ghel. We use targeted marketing strategies to attract serious, qualified investors for commercial and large agricultural holdings, ensuring you achieve the highest market valuation in the shortest possible timeline, managing all negotiations professionally."
