      {
        "question": "How quickly can property prices appreciate along the NH 22 Ambala corridor",
        "answer": "Property appreciation along the NH 22 corridor is typically faster than internal city areas due to its strategic location connecting Ambala to major transport routes. Appreciation rates heavily depend on nearby infrastructure development such as new commercial complexes flyovers and sectoral road projects. Generally well-located plots and commercial spaces near NH 22 have seen average annual appreciation ranging from 8% to 15% over the last five years especially in developing sectors making it a highly lucrative long-term investment destination."

        "question": "What is the standard payment structure for residential plots near NH 22",
        "answer": "The standard payment structure generally begins with a token amount usually 1% to 5% of the total cost to secure the plot. This is followed by a substantial booking amount or down payment typically 10% to 20% within 30 days while documentation is prepared. The remaining balance is paid either as a lump sum upon execution of the Sale Deed and Registry or through structured installment plans if the plot is part of a newly launched development scheme.

      {
        "question": "Are there specific building restrictions or height limitations near the National Highway",

      {
        "question": "Can I obtain a bank loan easily for buying a plot in a developing sector of Ambala on NH 22",
        "answer": "Bank loan availability depends primarily on the legal status of the plot and the developer's credentials. Plots within approved HUDA sectors or fully licensed private colonies with clear titles are generally eligible for loans from major national and private banks.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to invest in residential plots or commercial spaces along NH 22 for higher returns",
        "answer": "The better investment depends on your capital and risk tolerance. Residential plots offer steady moderate appreciation and lower entry cost with minimal maintenance. Commercial spaces on NH 22 especially those with highway frontage demand significantly higher capital but offer superior rental yields and often experience sharper capital appreciation particularly due to the high volume of traffic and business activity. We provide detailed comparative analysis based on current market trends to help you choose wisely."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the associated hidden costs beyond the plot purchase price",
