        "question": "Is Babyal a good area for long-term investment or is it primarily suitable for immediate residential use",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific building codes or floor area ratio restrictions I should know about in Babyal",
        "answer": "Yes, building constructions are governed by the local municipal corporation or development authority guidelines. These rules dictate the maximum height, setback rules (how far the structure must be from the boundary), and the Floor Area Ratio (FAR). We provide the latest zoning regulations relevant to your specific plot size and planned construction type."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the proximity to the main Ambala Cantt area affect property values in Babyal",

      {
        "question": "How important is the land mutation process after registration and can your team assist with it",
        "answer": "The land mutation process (Intakal) is critically important as it formally transfers the ownership records in the governmental revenue department records.

Our team provides complete support and follow-up to ensure the mutation is completed quickly and accurately after the sale deed is executed."
