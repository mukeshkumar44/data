      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for a Flat For Rent in Sherpur Village Ambala",
        "answer": "The standard rental agreement in Sherpur Village and across Ambala typically runs for 11 months, which is renewed upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. This 11-month contract structure is beneficial as it avoids complex registration requirements associated with a full one-year lease, making the process faster and more flexible for both parties. Longer leases of 18 or 24 months can sometimes be negotiated for corporate tenants or long-term residents, provided both the tenant and landlord agree to the terms and necessary legal registration is completed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is typically required for flats in this locality",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for a Flat For Rent in Sherpur Village generally ranges between one to two months' rent, depending on the flat size, the level of furnishing, and the landlord's policy. Fully furnished apartments often demand a slightly higher deposit due to the inclusion of valuable assets. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are settled. Always confirm the exact deposit amount and refund conditions before signing the lease agreement."
