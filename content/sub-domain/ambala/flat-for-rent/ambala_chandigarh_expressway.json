      },
      {
        "question": "How long are the typical lease agreements for rental properties in this area",
        "answer": "Most residential lease agreements for a Flat For Rent in Ambala Chandigarh Expressway are structured for a minimum duration of 11 months, which can then be renewed subject to mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord.

        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the quoted rental price for flats",

      },
      {
        "question": "What factors should I prioritize when choosing a specific sector for my rental flat location",
