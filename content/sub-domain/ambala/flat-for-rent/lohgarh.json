    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a Flat For Rent in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "The standard practice for residential rentals in Lohgarh Ambala generally requires a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy period, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills have been settled. However, certain premium or fully furnished properties may sometimes request three months' rent, though this is less common. We always ensure the deposit amount is clearly stipulated in the lease agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility charges included in the monthly rent for flats in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "In most standard rental agreements for a Flat For Rent in Lohgarh, utility charges such as electricity, water usage, and gas are not included in the monthly rent. These are typically managed and paid for directly by the tenant based on their consumption. Tenants are usually required to transfer utility connections into their name or pay based on sub-meter readings provided by the landlord or housing society. Always clarify which utilities are the tenant's responsibility and the process for meter reading during the lease finalization stage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is needed to finalize a rental agreement in Lohgarh Ambala",
        "answer": "To finalize a rental agreement, tenants are typically required to provide several key documents for verification. This includes government-issued photo identification such as an Aadhaar Card or Passport, proof of current employment or student status, and bank statements for background checks. Additionally, two passport-sized photographs and references from a previous landlord or employer may be requested. Providing all necessary documentation upfront speeds up the lease approval process significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common lease durations available for flats in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "The most common and preferred lease duration for a residential Flat For Rent in Lohgarh is 11 months, which is automatically renewable upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. This 11-month structure avoids certain legal complexities associated with leases exceeding one year. While shorter leases are rare, some landlords may agree to a 6-month term for corporate clients or those on specific assignments, but this often comes with a slight premium on the monthly rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often can the landlord increase the rent in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "Rental increases are generally stipulated in the lease agreement. For 11-month leases, the rent typically remains fixed for the entire duration. If the lease is renewed after 11 months, the landlord may propose a reasonable increase, usually ranging from 5% to 10%, depending on market conditions and any improvements made to the property. It is illegal for a landlord to arbitrarily increase the rent mid-tenancy, so always rely on the written terms of your agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental flats in Lohgarh Ambala",
        "answer": "The allowance of pets in a Flat For Rent in Lohgarh varies significantly depending on the specific landlord and the rules of the housing society or complex. Many residential societies have strict no-pet policies, especially in high-rise buildings. If you own a pet, it is absolutely essential to confirm pet allowance in writing before viewing the property. Some pet-friendly landlords may require an additional, non-refundable 'pet deposit' to cover potential cleaning or damages."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for property maintenance and repairs in a rented flat",
        "answer": "The division of maintenance responsibility is usually covered in the lease terms. Generally, the landlord is responsible for structural repairs, major plumbing issues, electrical wiring failure, and essential appliance maintenance if the flat is furnished. The tenant is typically responsible for minor running repairs, routine upkeep, and damages caused by their own negligence. You should immediately report any major issue to the landlord or the property management team to ensure timely resolution and avoid conflict."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I find fully furnished Flat For Rent in Lohgarh for short stays",
        "answer": "Yes, while 11-month leases are standard, there is a growing segment of fully furnished flats and service apartments in Lohgarh that cater to short-term needs, usually 3 to 6 months. These options often target professionals relocating temporarily or those seeking immediate, hassle-free accommodation. Due to the reduced commitment, these short-term leases usually command a slightly higher monthly rental rate compared to long-term agreements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the advantages of renting in Lohgarh compared to Ambala Cantt",
        "answer": "Lohgarh offers several distinct advantages including newer construction quality, generally lower traffic congestion, and more competitive rental prices for modern amenities. While Ambala Cantt offers proximity to older central markets, Lohgarh provides better access to major highways, newer shopping complexes, and often features integrated community living with dedicated parking and security systems which are highly valued by modern renters."
