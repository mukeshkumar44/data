      { "question": "What utility costs are typically included in the rent for Model Town apartments", "answer": "Generally, rent for a Flat For Rent in Model Town does not include utility costs.

      { "question": "Is Model Town well-connected by public transport for non-car owners", "answer": "Yes, Model Town Ambala is excellently served by local transportation networks.

      { "question": "How soon should I start looking for a Flat For Rent in Model Town before my required moving date", "answer": "Given the high demand for quality rental properties in Model Town, it is advisable to start your search actively about 4 to 6 weeks before your intended move-in date.

      { "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance in a Model Town rental flat", "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing, electrical system faults, and any required external maintenance of the building.

Always disclose that you have a pet early in the negotiation process when searching for a Flat For Rent to ensure compliance." },
      { "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for a Flat For Rent in Model Town", "answer": "Rental prices are often negotiable, especially if you commit to a longer lease period or if the flat has been vacant for some time.
