    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a flat for rent in Narain Garh Ambala",
        "answer": "The standard practice across Narain Garh and surrounding areas like Ambala is to request a security deposit equivalent to one or two months of rent. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease agreement, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are settled. Some premium or fully furnished flats might require a slightly higher deposit, possibly up to three months rent, due to the value of the assets involved. Always ensure the security deposit amount and the specific conditions for its refund are clearly itemized within the signed rental agreement before you commit to the tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are rental agreements in Narain Garh typically registered or notarized",

For shorter terms, usually eleven months or less, a simple notarized agreement is often used. However, for a Flat For Rent in Narain Garh, professional advice suggests always opting for a registered agreement even for shorter periods if you intend to use the address for official documentation like Aadhar updates or bank records.
