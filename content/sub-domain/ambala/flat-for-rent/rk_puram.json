    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for a Flat For Rent in RK Puram",
        "answer": "The standard lease duration across most residential areas in RK Puram is typically 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. This duration is preferred because it avoids the mandatory registration requirements and stamp duty associated with leases exceeding one year. However, longer terms such as 18 or 24 months can be negotiated for corporate or institutional rentals, provided both parties agree to the corresponding legal formalities and registration costs involved in a longer agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is typically required for rental flats in RK Puram",
        "answer": "For most Flats For Rent in RK Puram, landlords usually require a security deposit equivalent to two or three months' rent. This deposit is held as collateral against damages to the property or failure to pay rent. It is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy period, provided the property is returned in good condition and all outstanding dues, including electricity and water bills, have been settled. Always ensure the amount is clearly stated in the signed lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges usually included in the monthly rent in RK Puram apartments",
        "answer": "This depends heavily on the type of property you rent. For flats in gated societies or modern apartment complexes, a fixed monthly maintenance fee for common area services like security, lift operation, and garbage disposal is standard. Sometimes this fee is included in the monthly rent, but often it is an additional expense paid directly to the Residents Welfare Association RWA or the landlord. Always clarify who is responsible for paying the society maintenance charges before finalizing the lease for your RK Puram flat."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are needed to finalize a rental agreement in RK Puram",
        "answer": "To finalize a rental agreement for a Flat For Rent in RK Puram, you will typically need to provide valid identity proof such as Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and passport-size photographs. Additionally, the landlord may request proof of employment or student status, along with bank statements or references. For formal agreements, a notarized rent agreement is mandatory, and in some cases, police verification records of the tenant are also required as per local regulations for tenants residing in the area."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking available with all rental flats in the RK Puram neighborhood",
        "answer": "No, dedicated parking is not guaranteed for every Flat For Rent in RK Puram, especially older independent builder floors or DDA flats. If dedicated car parking is essential, you must confirm this detail explicitly during the viewing and ensure it is mentioned in the lease agreement. Flats in newer or cooperative group housing societies are more likely to offer allocated or basement parking facilities, often for a separate monthly charge."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the monthly rent for a flat in RK Puram",
        "answer": "Yes, rent negotiation is common, although the extent of flexibility depends on current market demand, the specific block in RK Puram, and the time of year. Landlords are generally more open to negotiation if you are looking for a longer lease term, offer a prompt move-in date, or have an excellent rental history. Our expert agents can assist you in negotiating a fair rental price, ensuring you get the best possible value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in rental properties in RK Puram",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords and housing societies in RK Puram. Many independent landlords may permit small pets, while some apartment complexes have strict no-pet rules due to RWA guidelines. It is crucial to inform us or the landlord about your pet ownership early in the search process to avoid future disputes. We focus on showing you flats where pet ownership is explicitly permitted under the rental terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utilities am I responsible for paying as a tenant in RK Puram",
        "answer": "As a tenant of a Flat For Rent in RK Puram, you are typically responsible for consumption-based utilities. This includes monthly electricity bills, water charges if not subsidized by the government or included in maintenance, and gas connection costs. Property tax and major structural repairs remain the responsibility of the landlord, while minor running repairs are generally handled by the tenant, as detailed in the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to secure a flat and move in once a listing is selected",
        "answer": "The process is usually swift once you have decided on a specific Flat For Rent in RK Puram. Typically, it takes about 3 to 7 business days from property selection to move-in. This time frame allows for final background checks, drafting and signing the notarized agreement, transferring the security deposit, and settling the first month's rent. Timely cooperation with documentation speeds up the entire move-in process significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the notice period required for vacating a rented flat in RK Puram",
        "answer": "The standard notice period specified in most RK Puram rental agreements is one to two months, typically 60 days.

Failure to provide adequate notice may result in the forfeiture of a portion or the entirety of your security deposit, as outlined in the initial lease agreement."
