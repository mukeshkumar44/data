        "question": "What is the typical security deposit requirement for a flat for rent in Ram Bagh Ambala",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Ram Bagh generally ranges from one to three months' worth of rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, assuming there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are settled. Premium or fully furnished flats might sometimes require a slightly higher deposit. We ensure this figure is clearly stated in the rental agreement before any commitment is made."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average price range for a 2 BHK flat for rent in Ram Bagh",

On average, you can expect prices to range between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000 per month. Highly modernized apartments in key residential pockets might fetch rents towards the higher end of this scale."

Always confirm the specific inclusion details when finalizing the lease agreement for your flat in Ram Bagh."

        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for rental properties in Ram Bagh Ambala City",
        "answer": "The most common and standard lease duration for residential properties in Ram Bagh is 11 months. This duration allows for simplified legal documentation that avoids mandatory registration requirements typical of 12-month leases under certain jurisdictions. Longer leases, such as 18 or 24 months, can be negotiated, but these usually require formal registration with stamp duty payment."

        "question": "Is it mandatory to register the rental agreement for a flat in Ram Bagh",
        "answer": "For lease agreements exceeding 11 months, registration is legally mandatory under the Registration Act of 1908. While 11-month agreements are commonly drafted on stamped paper and notarized, formal registration is highly recommended for any long-term occupancy regardless of the duration, as it offers the highest level of legal protection for both the landlord and the tenant in case of future disputes."

This proximity makes securing a flat for rent in Ram Bagh highly convenient for frequent travelers or those working near the station area."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and maintenance in a rented flat",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is responsible for minor repairs and routine upkeep, often referred to as 'wear and tear' maintenance. This includes fixing leaky taps, replacing light bulbs, or routine cleaning. The landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing overhauls, electrical wiring issues, and exterior maintenance. The precise delineation of responsibilities should be clearly detailed in the signed rental contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a flat in Ram Bagh if I have pets",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by landlords. While many properties in Ram Bagh Ambala are not explicitly pet-friendly, we do maintain a curated list of flats where landlords are willing to allow small pets, often requiring an increased security deposit or a specific 'pet clause' in the agreement. Be sure to inform your agent upfront if you require a pet-friendly rental flat."
