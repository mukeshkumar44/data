        "answer": "The typical lease agreement in Ghel usually spans 11 months, which is commonly renewed upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord.

      {
        "question": "Are flats for rent in Ghel usually furnished or unfurnished",

        "question": "What factors should I consider regarding connectivity when renting in Ghel",

Always clarify in the lease agreement who is responsible for specific society or common area maintenance charges before moving into your new flat."
