      },
      {
        "question": "Which areas in Ambala Cantt offer the best commercial potential",
        "answer": "Sadar Bazar and Railway Road remain the most established commercial hubs with highest footfall. Emerging areas like Kingsway Camp and Cantonment Board Market are gaining popularity due to new residential developments. The choice depends on your business type - established markets suit retail, while newer areas work well for services and specialty stores."
      },
      {
        "question": "What legal documents should I verify before buying a shop",
        "answer": "Essential documents include the original sale deed, latest property tax receipts, approved building plans, NOC from Cantonment Board, encumbrance certificate for last 30 years, and possession certificate. For leasehold properties, verify lease terms and transfer permissions. We recommend consulting a property lawyer to ensure all documents are in order before finalizing any purchase."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any restrictions on business types in cantonment area shops",
        "answer": "Certain business activities may require special permissions in cantonment areas. While most retail and service businesses are permitted, establishments like bars, nightclubs, or hazardous material storage have restrictions. The Cantonment Board provides clear guidelines, and we can help you verify if your planned business complies with local regulations before you make a purchase."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the rental yield for shops in Ambala Cantt",
        "answer": "Commercial properties in Ambala Cantt typically offer 6-9% annual rental yield, with prime locations commanding higher returns. Smaller shops in busy markets often have better yields (8-9%) due to lower purchase prices and consistent demand. Rental values range from ₹50-150 per sq ft monthly depending on location, with established markets at the higher end of this spectrum."
      },
      {
        "question": "What financing options are available for shop purchases",
        "answer": "Most national and private banks offer commercial property loans covering 60-70% of property value at interest rates slightly higher than home loans. Loan tenure usually extends up to 15 years. NBFCs may provide more flexible terms for older properties. We can connect you with preferred banking partners who specialize in commercial real estate financing in Ambala region."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does cantonment status affect property ownership",
        "answer": "Cantonment Board administers these areas with specific regulations different from municipal corporations. While ownership rights remain strong, certain modifications or business operations may require Board approvals. The advantage is better infrastructure maintenance and security. We ensure all our listed properties have clear titles and comply with cantonment regulations for hassle-free ownership."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance charges apply to shop properties",
        "answer": "Maintenance costs vary by property type. Standalone shops typically have minimal charges (₹500-2000 monthly) for municipal services. Market complex shops may have higher maintenance (₹3-10/sq ft monthly) covering common area upkeep, security, and utilities. Cantonment Board charges annual property tax around 1-1.5% of assessed value. We provide complete cost breakdowns for each property to help you budget accurately."

      },
