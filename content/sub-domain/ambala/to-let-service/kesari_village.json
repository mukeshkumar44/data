    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to rent a residential property in Kesari Village Ambala",
        "answer": "For tenants, standard documentation includes proof of identity such as Aadhaar Card or Passport, proof of current address, and proof of employment or income stability, often in the form of salary slips or bank statements. Landlords typically require copies of the property ownership documents, tax receipts, and their own identity proofs. Our To Let Service team ensures all necessary documents are collected and verified efficiently before the lease signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lease duration for flats found via the To Let Service",
        "answer": "The standard lease duration in Kesari Village and across Ambala is usually 11 months, which is often renewed upon mutual agreement. An 11-month agreement avoids the requirement for full registration under the Registration Act of 1908, making the process smoother and less costly initially. Longer lease terms, such as 24 or 36 months, can be negotiated for specific commercial properties or premium residential units if both parties agree."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit amount requested for properties in Kesari Village",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Kesari Village Ambala generally ranges from one to three months’ rent, depending on the property type, the landlord’s preference, and whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy and is refundable at the end of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills are cleared."
      },
      {
        "question": "As a landlord, how quickly can your To Let Service find a suitable tenant for my property",
        "answer": "Our effectiveness depends on the market price, property condition, and current demand. However, due to our extensive marketing reach and database of pre-qualified tenants, we generally aim to secure a suitable tenant within 15 to 45 days. Properties priced competitively and in excellent condition usually rent out much faster through our focused promotional efforts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance during a tenancy agreement",
        "answer": "Lease agreements generally stipulate that minor repairs such as light bulb replacement or basic plumbing issues are the responsibility of the tenant. Major structural repairs, electrical wiring faults, or issues arising from building defects or natural wear and tear are typically the responsibility of the landlord. Our comprehensive lease agreement explicitly outlines these responsibilities to prevent disputes during the tenancy in Kesari Village."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price on a listing I find through your service",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is a standard part of the rental process. While property owners list their properties at the optimal market price, our agents can facilitate negotiations between you and the landlord. Success depends on the length of the lease you are willing to commit to and current market dynamics for that specific type of property in Kesari Village Ambala."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the monthly rent in Kesari Village rentals",
        "answer": "In almost all residential and commercial rentals in Kesari Village, utility bills such as electricity, water, gas, and internet are separate charges and are not included in the monthly rent. The tenant is typically responsible for setting up accounts in their name and paying these bills directly. Our team assists tenants with the handover process for meter readings and account transfers upon move-in."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you handle the police verification process for new tenants",
        "answer": "Yes, as per Government of India regulations and local Ambala police guidelines, mandatory police verification of tenants is required. Our To Let Service assists landlords in completing this essential formality, ensuring that all necessary paperwork is submitted accurately and promptly to the relevant authorities, ensuring compliance and security for the community."
      },
      {
        "question": "What protection does your service offer against fraudulent listings or scams",
        "answer": "Our primary protection is our strict verification protocol. We only list properties where we have confirmed the identity of the owner and verified the legal standing of the property. We never ask for payment upfront before a physical viewing and signed agreement, drastically minimizing the risk of fraud associated with the rental process in Kesari Village."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for renewing a lease agreement after the initial term ends",
        "answer": "Approximately two months before the lease expiry date, our service proactively contacts both the landlord and tenant to gauge their interest in renewal. If both parties agree, we facilitate the negotiation of the new rental rate and terms, and draft a new lease agreement or a simple renewal addendum, ensuring continuous tenancy without hassle."
