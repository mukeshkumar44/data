    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical brokerage fee charged by a To Let Service in Laxmi Nagar for residential rentals",
        "answer": "Brokerage fees generally vary based on market practice and property type. For residential rentals in Laxmi Nagar, the standard fee for tenants is typically equivalent to one month's rent, payable upon successful execution of the lease agreement. Landlords usually have slightly different fee structures depending on the level of management services they require, ranging from a fixed percentage of the annual rent to a standard one month's rent for tenant placement. We maintain transparency regarding all fees from the very first consultation, ensuring no hidden surprises during the transaction process."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it usually take to find a rental property using your To Let services",
        "answer": "The duration depends primarily on the tenant's specific criteria and market availability at the time. Due to the high demand in Laxmi Nagar, properties move quickly. However, because our service maintains a pre-vetted database of properties and offers personalized matching, we significantly reduce search time. Most clients are able to shortlist and finalize a property within 5 to 10 days of starting their active search with us, especially if their requirements are clearly defined and realistic within the current market rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you assist with the mandatory police verification process for new tenants in Delhi",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Assisting with the mandatory police verification is an integral part of our professional To Let Service package. As per Delhi law, it is essential for both the landlord and tenant to complete this process. We guide the landlord through the necessary paperwork and submission procedures, ensuring full compliance with local regulatory requirements. This step is vital for security and peace of mind for both parties involved in the tenancy agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a rental agreement through your service",
        "answer": "The primary documents required from tenants typically include valid photo ID and address proof such as Aadhar Card or Passport, PAN Card, and often proof of employment or student status. Landlords must provide proof of ownership, property tax receipts, and necessary identity documents. We handle the drafting of the legally binding lease agreement, which includes critical terms such as rent amount, security deposit, duration, and maintenance responsibilities, ensuring all documents are correctly attested and executed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I list my commercial property or office space in Laxmi Nagar through your To Let platform",
        "answer": "Yes, our To Let Service extends comprehensive support for commercial properties including retail shops, office spaces, and warehouse facilities in and around Laxmi Nagar. We understand the unique requirements of commercial leasing, focusing on factors like foot traffic, zoning regulations, and lease flexibility. Our commercial property experts help landlords price their spaces competitively and connect them with high-quality business tenants looking for prime locations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure the security deposit is protected during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "The security deposit is traditionally held by the landlord throughout the tenancy period. Our role involves clearly documenting the condition of the property before move-in through a detailed inspection report and photographic evidence. This record serves as the basis for assessing any damages beyond normal wear and tear when the tenant vacates. We mediate the return process, ensuring deductions, if any, are fair and justified according to the terms stipulated in the original rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer property management services after placing a tenant",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer comprehensive property management packages that go beyond simple tenant placement. These services are invaluable for non-resident landlords or those who prefer a hands-off approach. Property management includes rent collection, handling maintenance requests, periodic property inspections, and lease renewal management. This ensures your investment in Laxmi Nagar is protected and your rental income stream remains consistent and hassle-free."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a 1RK and a 1BHK apartment in Laxmi Nagar rentals",
        "answer": "A 1RK means one room and a kitchen, implying that the single room serves as both the living and sleeping area. This configuration is generally smaller and more budget-friendly. A 1BHK means one bedroom, one hall (living room), and a kitchen. The key difference is the separate living space or hall in the 1BHK, offering more functional area and privacy. When utilizing our To Let Service, we ensure these property types are accurately described so tenants can make informed decisions based on their spatial needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pet-friendly rentals available through your service in Laxmi Nagar",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by property owners. While Laxmi Nagar, being a dense residential area, often has restrictions, we actively maintain a database of properties where landlords are open to or specifically permit pets. When contacting us, please specify your requirement for a pet-friendly rental property so our agents can immediately filter and present suitable listings that align with your needs and the landlord's regulations, potentially saving significant search time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I view properties virtually before scheduling a physical visit",
        "answer": "In response to modern demands for efficiency and safety, we increasingly offer virtual tours and high-quality video walkthroughs for many of our exclusive listings. This allows prospective tenants to gauge the layout, condition, and overall feel of the property from afar.
