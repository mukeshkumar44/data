      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit amount required for rental properties in Geeta Colony",

We ensure the security deposit clauses are explicitly detailed in the final rental agreement for clarity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to find a reliable tenant using your To Let Service in Geeta Colony",
        "answer": "Due to the high demand for housing in Geeta Colony and our dedicated marketing efforts, the average time to secure a reliable, verified tenant is remarkably fast, often within two to four weeks of listing.

The exact division of responsibilities is always specified in the rental contract."

We strive for fair pricing that reflects the property’s value and current Geeta Colony rental trends."
      },
