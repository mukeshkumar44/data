      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to find a qualified tenant in RK Puram",
        "answer": "The average vacancy period in RK Puram is highly dependent on factors like property condition, competitive pricing, and current market demand in the sector. However, due to our extensive marketing reach and database of pre-qualified tenants, we typically secure a high-quality tenant within 14 to 30 days of listing the property on the market. Accurate pricing based on our detailed comparative market analysis is the single biggest factor in reducing vacancy time, which we prioritize immediately during the initial onboarding process."
      },
      {
        "question": "As a tenant, what documents do I need to secure a rental property through your service",
        "answer": "Tenants will generally need to provide valid photo identification, typically an Aadhar card or passport copy, proof of current employment or income documentation such as the last three months of salary slips or bank statements, and verifiable references from a previous landlord if applicable to your situation. Depending on the property owner's specific requirements, a credit score check authorization may also be necessary. Providing all these required documents promptly significantly speeds up the verification and final approval process."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are maintenance and repairs handled during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "Tenants report maintenance issues directly to our dedicated property management team via our secure online portal or our 24/7 emergency line for critical situations. We immediately assess the urgency of the repair and coordinate quickly with our trusted network of vetted, licensed local vendors operating across RK Puram. For standard, non-emergency repairs, we aim for resolution within 48 hours. Owners receive detailed reports and estimates for any major work before approval and execution, ensuring total transparency regarding property expenditures."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit amount required for rentals in this area",
        "answer": "In RK Puram, the typical security deposit required for standard residential rentals ranges from two to three months' worth of the agreed-upon monthly rent value. This deposit is held securely in compliance with all relevant local regulations and is utilized only to cover potential damages beyond normal wear and tear or outstanding rent at the end of the tenancy. We manage the deposit return process meticulously, mediating any potential disputes fairly upon the tenant move-out inspection."
      },

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if a tenant misses a rent payment",
        "answer": "We have a clear, established, and legally compliant protocol for dealing with late rent payments swiftly. Our process involves immediate professional communication with the tenant regarding the outstanding balance, followed by issuing necessary formal late payment notices according to the precise terms of the lease agreement and local tenancy laws. If payment remains consistently outstanding, we swiftly initiate the appropriate legal steps for eviction while keeping the property owner fully informed at every single stage of the arrears recovery process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utilities typically included in the rental price in RK Puram properties",
        "answer": "Generally, utilities such as electricity, running water charges, and cooking gas connections are not included in the basic stated rental price for standard flats and independent floors in RK Puram. The tenant is usually fully responsible for setting up and paying for these specific services directly. However, in some premium service apartments or properties, consolidated water charges or common area maintenance fees might be included. We ensure all inclusions and exclusions are clarified explicitly and in writing in the lease agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do you perform property inspections during a tenancy",
        "answer": "We typically conduct detailed property inspections semi-annually, or once every six months, in addition to the mandatory initial move-in and final move-out inspections. These periodic checks are essential for ensuring the property is being maintained appropriately by the tenant, helping us identify any necessary preventative maintenance needs early, and fulfilling specific insurance requirements. Detailed photo reports of these scheduled inspections are always provided promptly to the property owner."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does your To Let service assist tenants moving out of RK Puram",
        "answer": "When tenants decide to vacate the property, we provide clear, comprehensive guidance on the move-out process, including required notice periods, detailed cleaning standards necessary for the full deposit return, and the final inspection schedule. We facilitate a smooth and structured transition, ensuring the timely return of the security deposit once all lease obligations are met and the property condition is professionally approved, making your relocation or next step stress-free."
