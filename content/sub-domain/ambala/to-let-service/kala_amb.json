        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Kala Amb usually ranges from one to two months’ rent depending on the property type, the landlord’s preference, and whether the unit is furnished or unfurnished. Commercial leases sometimes require higher deposits due to the specialized infrastructure involved. We hold the security deposit in a secure account and ensure its timely refund, minus any justifiable damages, upon the successful conclusion of the lease period and handover inspection."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to find a tenant using your To Let service",
        "answer": "The time required varies based on market demand, rental price, and property condition. However, due to our extensive marketing reach and proactive tenant screening, most well-priced residential properties in high-demand areas of Kala Amb are rented within two to four weeks. We immediately market your property across major portals and to our pre-vetted database of active renters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are your rental agreements legally binding and registered with the local authorities",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. All rental agreements facilitated through our To Let service in Kala Amb are legally sound and prepared according to the required governmental guidelines. While mandatory registration depends on the lease tenure and state law, we strongly advise registration for long-term leases (over 11 months) to ensure maximum legal protection for both the landlord and the tenant, and we handle this registration process for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of maintenance support do you provide for tenants during the lease period",
        "answer": "We offer immediate response maintenance support. Tenants can submit maintenance requests 24/7 through our online portal. For managed properties, we coordinate reputable local vendors to address issues like plumbing, electrical faults, and structural repairs promptly.

      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need to break my rental lease early in Kala Amb",
