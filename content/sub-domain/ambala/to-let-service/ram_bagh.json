      {
        "question": "What measures do you take to verify the financial stability of prospective tenants",
        "answer": "Tenant financial stability is crucial for ensuring timely rent payments. We require comprehensive proof of income, typically including salary slips for the last three months, employment verification letters, and bank statements. For self-employed individuals, we request Income Tax Returns (ITR) and business proofs. This thorough financial vetting process is a core component of our commitment to property owners in Ram Bagh."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical deposit and lock-in period required for rentals secured through your service in Ram Bagh",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Ram Bagh generally ranges from two to three months' worth of rent, which is held by the landlord or property manager and returned to the tenant upon lease completion, subject to property inspection for damages. The typical lock-in period, during which neither party can terminate the lease without penalty, is six months, followed by a standard notice period (usually one or two months) for termination of the full 11-month or 12-month agreement."

        "question": "How is rent collected and disbursed to the property owner using your Ram Bagh To Let Service",
        "answer": "We manage the entire rent collection process electronically. Tenants pay the rent directly to our designated account, typically on or before the 5th of every month.

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if a tenant causes damage to the rental property beyond normal wear and tear",
        "answer": "Our legal agreements clearly outline tenant responsibilities regarding property maintenance and damage. If damage occurs beyond acceptable wear and tear, the cost of repairs is deducted from the tenant’s security deposit. In cases where the damage exceeds the deposit amount, we pursue legal remedies and liaise with the property owner to recover the full repair cost, ensuring your asset in Ram Bagh is protected."
