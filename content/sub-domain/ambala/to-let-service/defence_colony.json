        "answer": "Tenants generally need to provide proof of identity such as an Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current address, and professional or employment verification letters demonstrating stable income. For corporate leases additional company registration documents and authorized signatory details are mandatory. We ensure all submitted documents are handled with the strictest confidentiality and adhere fully to data protection regulations throughout the verification process for your security."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the average process take from initial inquiry to finally signing the lease agreement in Defence Colony",
        "answer": "Due to the highly competitive nature of high-end Defence Colony rentals we prioritize speed and efficiency. Typically if a tenant is prepared with all necessary documents and immediately accepts the terms the process can be completed within 7 to 14 business days. This timeframe includes property viewing, negotiation, final documentation preparation, and successful agreement signing ensuring minimal delay in securing your desired property."

      {
        "question": "Do you charge a separate fee to landlords and tenants for using your To Let Service and how is this calculated",
        "answer": "Yes our service involves a professional fee which is standard in the Defence Colony market. For tenants the fee is usually equivalent to one month’s rent plus applicable GST upon successful signing of the lease. For landlords the fee structure can vary based on the level of property management required but typically involves a percentage of the annual rent or a full month’s rent for simple leasing. All fees are discussed clearly upfront with full transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit requirement for residential properties in the Defence Colony area",
        "answer": "In Defence Colony the standard security deposit for premium residential properties typically ranges from two to four months’ worth of rent. This amount is legally held by the landlord and is refundable at the end of the tenancy subject to the property being returned in the same condition as leased minus normal wear and tear. We ensure the deposit clause is clearly defined in the lease agreement protecting both parties equally."

We provide regular updates throughout the process maintaining complete transparency despite the geographical distance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer property management services after the rental agreement has been successfully signed by both parties",
        "answer": "Yes we offer comprehensive property management packages that extend well beyond the initial leasing phase. These services can include monthly rent collection, handling routine maintenance and repair requests from tenants, quarterly property inspections, and full lease renewal management.
