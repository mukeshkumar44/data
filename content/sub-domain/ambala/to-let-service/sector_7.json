      {
        "question": "What security measures do you take to verify the identity and reliability of potential tenants",

      {
        "question": "What is the standard duration for a residential rental agreement handled by your team",
        "answer": "The standard residential rental agreement in Sector 7 Ambala is typically executed for eleven months. This duration is advantageous for both parties as it legally avoids the complexity of compulsory registration required for leases exceeding one year. We manage the renewal process proactively well before the agreement expires, ensuring continuity for the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "As a tenant, what are the typical upfront costs associated with renting a home in Sector 7",
        "answer": "Tenants should generally budget for three main upfront costs. This includes the first months rent in advance, a security deposit which is usually equivalent to two months of rent and is refundable upon lease termination, and our brokerage or service fee, which is negotiated based on the lease terms but often equates to one months rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and maintenance during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "Standard practice in rental agreements managed by us dictates that minor repairs and routine maintenance of household appliances or fittings fall under the tenants responsibility.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is it mandatory to register the rental agreement for properties in Sector 7",
