    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for residential properties in Devi Nagar",
        "answer": "The standard practice for residential rentals through our To Let Service in Devi Nagar Ambala is a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy term, provided there are no damages beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are settled accurately. Commercial properties may require a slightly larger deposit, usually ranging from three to six months rent, depending on the scale and fit-out requirements of the tenant."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it usually take to find a reliable tenant using your To Let Service in Devi Nagar",
        "answer": "Due to our extensive marketing reach and database of pre-qualified applicants, the average time to secure a reliable tenant for a well-priced property in Devi Nagar is typically between 7 to 15 days. High-demand residential units near key infrastructure often rent even faster because we handle all pre-screening quickly. Our efficiency in minimizing vacancy periods is a key reason why property owners choose our specialized To Let Service Ambala."
      },
      {
        "question": "What legal documents are mandatory when signing a rent agreement in Ambala",
        "answer": "A notarized Rent Agreement is mandatory, detailing the monthly rent, maintenance charges, lease duration, security deposit amount, and clear termination clauses. Both the landlord and tenant must provide valid government identification such as Aadhaar and PAN cards. For tenants, additional documentation proving employment or student status is generally required for our comprehensive verification process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and maintenance in a rented flat in Devi Nagar",
        "answer": "Generally, minor running repairs, such as addressing faulty light bulbs, minor plumbing issues like leaky taps, or general cosmetic maintenance, fall under the tenant's responsibility. Major structural repairs, issues with external plumbing, waterproofing, or failure of the main electrical system are typically the responsibility of the landlord, as explicitly specified within the detailed lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet a property I am renting through your To Let Service in Devi Nagar Ambala",
        "answer": "Subletting is strictly prohibited unless explicit written permission is granted by the landlord and is formally added as a legal addendum to the original lease agreement. Unauthorised subletting constitutes a severe breach of contract and can lead to immediate termination of the tenancy, as we strive to protect the integrity of the property owner's valuable investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the rent escalation or increase managed for long-term leases",
        "answer": "For standard 11-month residential agreements, the rent typically remains fixed for the entire term. For leases extending beyond 12 months, or for renewable agreements, a rent escalation clause is often included in the contract. This clause usually specifies a potential increase of 5% to 10% upon renewal, based on current market trends and is always negotiated and agreed upon before the initial lease signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer services for listing commercial properties and large warehouses",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Our To Let Service excels in commercial property leasing, covering everything from high-street retail shops and corporate office spaces to industrial plots and storage warehouses in and around Devi Nagar Ambala. We utilize specialized marketing strategies to match complex commercial clients with properties that perfectly meet their demanding logistical and operational requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What crucial checks do you perform on tenants before handing over the keys",
        "answer": "We conduct comprehensive due diligence including verifying the tenant's current and permanent address, checking employment status and confirming salary details. Mandatory police verification submission is performed as required by local law. We also seek and verify professional references from previous landlords wherever possible to ensure maximum peace of mind for the property owner."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to break the lease early as a tenant",
        "answer": "Breaking a lease early usually requires the tenant to provide a mandatory notice period, typically ranging from 30 to 60 days, as clearly outlined in the tenancy contract. Additionally, the tenant may forfeit the security deposit or be required to pay a penalty equivalent to one or two months rent, depending on the specific terms negotiated for the property in Devi Nagar Ambala."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is your To Let Service fee paid by the landlord, the tenant, or both parties",
        "answer": "Our professional service fee structure varies based on the type of property and the extent of management service provided. Generally, a small, industry-standard brokerage fee is charged to both the landlord and the tenant upon successful signing of the lease agreement, ensuring fair and professional handling of the entire transaction process for properties in Devi Nagar."
