    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard duration for a rental agreement using your To Let service in Ambala Sadar",
        "answer": "The standard rental agreement duration in Ambala Sadar is typically 11 months, which is renewed upon mutual agreement. An 11-month agreement avoids certain registration complexities required for leases exceeding one year. However, if a tenant or landlord requires a longer duration, such as 24 or 36 months, we can facilitate the necessary documentation and mandatory registration as per state law in Haryana."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the security deposit managed when renting a property in Ambala Sadar",
        "answer": "The security deposit usually amounts to two to three months' rent, depending on the property type and location within Ambala Sadar. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy as security against damage or non-payment of rent or utilities. We ensure the terms for deposit deduction and refund are clearly specified in the registered lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "As a landlord, how quickly can your service find a qualified tenant for my Ambala Sadar property",
        "answer": "Our efficiency depends on market conditions and the competitiveness of your rental pricing. For residential properties priced correctly near the market average, we typically secure a qualified tenant within 15 to 30 days due to our aggressive marketing and verified database. Commercial properties may take slightly longer, usually 30 to 45 days in Ambala Sadar."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need police verification for a tenant in Ambala Sadar Ambala",
        "answer": "Yes, police verification is a mandatory legal requirement for all landlords in Haryana, including Ambala Sadar. It is a crucial step for safety and legal compliance. Our To Let service assists landlords by providing the necessary forms and guiding them through the submission process to ensure timely and correct tenant registration with the local police authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical maintenance responsibilities defined in the rental agreement",
        "answer": "Generally, tenants are responsible for minor repairs and routine wear and tear maintenance such as light bulb replacements, cleaning, and upkeep of appliances they install. Landlords are typically responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing leaks, and electrical wiring issues. Our agreements clearly demarcate these responsibilities to prevent disputes during the tenancy period in Ambala Sadar."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a property in Ambala Sadar without visiting it in person",
        "answer": "While highly recommended, physically visiting a property is not always necessary. We offer high-definition virtual tours, detailed video walkthroughs, and live video conferencing sessions with our agents. This allows out-of-town tenants to make informed decisions about properties in Ambala Sadar with full confidence in the listing's accuracy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do tenants need to submit when applying for a rental property",
        "answer": "Prospective tenants must typically provide a valid government ID proof such as Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current employment or business details, salary slips or bank statements for financial verification, and references from a previous landlord if applicable. We handle the collection and verification of these necessary documents in Ambala Sadar."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are brokerage fees calculated for the To Let service in Ambala Sadar",
        "answer": "Brokerage fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the total annual rent or as equivalent to one month's rent, which is split between the tenant and the landlord or paid entirely by one party, depending on the current market practice and negotiation terms. Our fee structure is competitive and discussed clearly at the outset before any viewings take place."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the rent for properties listed through your service",
        "answer": "No, utility bills such as electricity, water, and gas charges are almost always separate from the base rent unless specifically stated otherwise in the agreement for serviced apartments. Tenants are responsible for paying these bills based on their actual consumption during their occupancy of the property in Ambala Sadar. We help facilitate the transfer of utility accounts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if a tenant wants to terminate the lease early in Ambala Sadar",
        "answer": "Early termination requires the tenant to provide advance notice, usually 30 to 60 days, as stipulated in the lease agreement. Depending on the contract terms, penalties might apply, often resulting in the forfeiture of the security deposit or a portion thereof. We mediate this process to ensure minimal financial disruption for the landlord."
