    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required from tenants when renting a property in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "When engaging our To Let Service in Tagore Garden, tenants are typically required to provide proof of identity such as Aadhar Card and PAN Card. Additionally, we need proof of current employment or income verification, usually in the form of the last three months' salary slips or an employment contract. For non-salaried individuals or businesses, relevant financial statements might be requested. Address proof and references from a previous landlord are highly recommended to expedite the vetting and approval process efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is standard for rental properties managed by your service",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in the Tagore Garden rental market is usually equivalent to two or three months' rent. This deposit is held against any damages beyond normal wear and tear or unpaid utilities upon the termination of the lease agreement. The specific amount can vary slightly depending on the type of property, whether it is furnished or unfurnished, and the landlord's preference. We ensure this deposit amount and the terms of its refund are clearly stipulated in the legal lease document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance during the tenancy period in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "Generally, the responsibility is split as per standard rental agreements facilitated by our To Let Service. The landlord is typically responsible for structural repairs, major electrical or plumbing issues, and capital expenditures. The tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs, upkeep, and maintenance resulting from day-to-day usage, such as replacing light bulbs or fixing minor leaks caused by negligence. All responsibilities are explicitly detailed in the agreement to avoid confusion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long are the typical lease agreements for residential flats in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "Most residential lease agreements arranged through our To Let Service have a standard duration of 11 months, which is frequently renewed if both the tenant and landlord are satisfied. Longer leases, such as 12, 18, or 24 months, can also be negotiated, especially for corporate clients or highly stable tenants. We advise planning for renewal discussions approximately two months before the current lease expires to ensure continuity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rental price listed on your website for a property in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is a standard part of the renting process. Our To Let agents are highly skilled negotiators who work to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. While listed prices are generally market-driven, we present all reasonable offers to the landlord and provide data-backed justifications. Factors like lease duration, move-in date, and whether the tenant agrees to pay a higher security deposit can influence the final agreed-upon rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for listing my property with your To Let Service in Tagore Garden",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in rental properties advertised in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "The pet policy is entirely dependent on the individual landlord and the specific housing society rules. While many independent builder floors may be more flexible, many apartment complexes have strict no-pet rules. Our website listings clearly indicate the pet policy where available, and you can use our advanced search filters to prioritize pet-friendly rental options within the Tagore Garden area."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical notice period required for terminating a lease early in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "The standard notice period specified in our leases is typically one or two months for both the tenant and the landlord wishing to terminate the agreement. If a tenant breaks the lock-in period, which is often six months, they may be required to forfeit the security deposit or pay rent for the remaining period until a new tenant is found, as per the signed contract clauses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you charge a fee to tenants for finding a rental property in Tagore Garden",
        "answer": "As a professional real estate consultancy offering specialized To Let services, a brokerage fee is charged to the tenant upon successful finalization and signing of the lease agreement. This fee covers our extensive services including personalized property matching, verified listings access, guided viewings, negotiation, and preparation of all legal documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure the property remains well-maintained when I list it for rent as a landlord",
        "answer": "We offer comprehensive property management services that can be added to the standard To Let service.
