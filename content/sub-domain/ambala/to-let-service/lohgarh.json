    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How long does it usually take to find a tenant using your To Let Service in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "The duration depends heavily on the property type, location within Lohgarh, and the rental price point. However, due to our extensive marketing network and robust tenant database, we typically manage to secure a qualified, verified tenant within 15 to 30 days of listing. Properties priced competitively and in prime sectors often lease even faster. We actively promote your property across online portals, social media, and local networks to ensure maximum exposure and minimal vacancy time for landlords utilizing our dedicated To Let service."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of tenant verification process do you follow for properties in Lohgarh Ambala",
        "answer": "Our verification process is comprehensive and thorough. It includes mandatory identity verification using government-issued IDs, employment confirmation through salary slips or employer contact, previous landlord reference checks, and a police verification submission as mandated by local law. For corporate tenants, we verify company registration documents. This rigorous screening protects the property owner and ensures responsible tenancy across all properties handled by our To Let service."
      },
      {
        "question": "As a tenant, what are the typical upfront costs involved in renting a property in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "Generally, tenants are required to pay three main upfront costs. The first is the security deposit, which usually equals one or two months rent, refundable upon lease completion. The second is the first months advance rent. The third is our professional service fee or brokerage, which is dependent on the lease term but typically equates to half a months or a full months rent. We ensure all these charges are clearly communicated before any commitment is made."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you handle the maintenance and repair issues during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer full property management support as an optional add-on service. If opted for, we become the primary point of contact for the tenant regarding routine maintenance and minor repairs. We coordinate vetted vendors, manage repair invoices, and ensure that the property remains in excellent condition throughout the tenancy, reducing stress for the landlord. Major capital repairs remain the owners responsibility, but we facilitate necessary communication."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of rental properties are most popular currently in Lohgarh",
        "answer": "Currently, 2 BHK and 3 BHK semi-furnished apartments in gated communities are experiencing the highest demand in Lohgarh, particularly those close to the main industrial or educational zones. Independent houses are also sought after by larger families. Our To Let service keeps track of these shifting demands, ensuring that we strategically market your property to the specific demographic most likely to rent it quickly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are rental agreements structured through your To Let service",
        "answer": "Rental agreements are typically structured for a period of 11 months, renewable thereafter, which is the standard practice for residential rentals in Ambala. Commercial leases often span 3 to 5 years. All agreements include clauses covering rent escalation, termination notice periods, property usage rules, and security deposit terms. We ensure the contract is notarized or registered as required by law for maximum protection."
      },
      {

        "answer": "Absolutely. Our commercial To Let division specializes in locating prime retail and F&B spaces. We identify properties with appropriate ventilation systems, sufficient power load capacity, visible storefronts, and necessary permissions for commercial operation in high-foot-traffic areas of Lohgarh. Contact our commercial property expert to discuss your specific requirements including seating capacity and licensing needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if the tenant breaches the lease agreement early",
        "answer": "Our lease agreements are robust and clearly outline penalties and procedures for early termination or breach of terms. We act quickly to formally communicate the breach and negotiate the required resolution, typically involving forfeiture of the security deposit or payment of a penalty period rent. If negotiations fail, we assist the landlord in following the appropriate legal steps necessary for eviction in the Ambala jurisdiction."

      {
        "question": "Is it necessary for the property owner to be present during viewings in Lohgarh",

This allows the property owner to manage their time without being physically present for every showing. We ensure the property is secured before and after each viewing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you charge separate fees for listing both residential and commercial properties",
        "answer": "Our service fees are calculated based on the complexity and value of the lease secured. While the fee structure is consistent, the percentage applied may differ slightly between high-value commercial leases and standard residential rentals due to the difference in market complexity and lease terms. We provide a detailed, no-obligation fee quote specific to your property type in Lohgarh before any listing agreement is signed."
