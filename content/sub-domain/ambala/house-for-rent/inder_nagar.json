        "answer": "Most landlords in Inder Nagar Ambala typically request a security deposit equivalent to two to three months of the agreed-upon rent.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills like electricity and water included in the monthly rent in Inder Nagar",
        "answer": "Generally, utility bills are separate and are the responsibility of the tenant unless explicitly stated otherwise in the rental contract.
