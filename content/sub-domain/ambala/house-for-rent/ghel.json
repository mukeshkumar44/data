    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a house for rent in Ghel",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for houses for rent in Ghel generally ranges from one to two months worth of rent. This amount is held by the landlord throughout the lease period and is refundable upon the tenant vacating the property, provided there is no significant damage beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills are cleared. Specific terms are always clearly stipulated in the rental agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the monthly rent for Ghel properties",
        "answer": "In almost all cases, utility bills such as electricity, water, gas, and internet are not included in the monthly rent for a house for rent in Ghel. The tenant is typically responsible for setting up accounts with the respective service providers and paying these charges directly. It is essential to confirm the status of water supply charges, as sometimes ground water charges might be included, but this varies property by property."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for rental houses in Ghel Ambala",

This duration is often favored because it simplifies registration requirements, though longer 12-month or multi-year leases are also possible.

        "question": "How quickly can I move into a house for rent after finalizing the agreement",

Generally, once the lease agreement is signed, the security deposit and first month's rent are paid, and keys can often be handed over within 2 to 5 business days, allowing time for initial utility transfer arrangements."
      },
