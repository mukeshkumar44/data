Always confirm the exact amount and the conditions for refund clearly in the written lease agreement before making any payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Jasmeet Nagar generally pet-friendly",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords in Jasmeet Nagar. While independent houses generally offer more flexibility than apartments, many landlords still impose restrictions on the type or size of pets.
