      { "question": "Is it better to rent an independent house or an apartment in Ambala Sadar", "answer": "Choosing between an independent House For Rent and an apartment depends entirely on your priority.

      { "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for a House For Rent in Ambala Sadar", "answer": "Yes, rent negotiation is standard practice in the Ambala Sadar real estate market.

      { "question": "How important is property registration for rental agreements in Ambala", "answer": "Registering a lease agreement for a House For Rent is mandatory under Indian law if the lease term is 12 months or more.
