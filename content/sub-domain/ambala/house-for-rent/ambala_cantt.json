    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for rental homes in Ambala Cantt",
        "answer": "The standard practice for a House For Rent in Ambala Cantt is usually a security deposit equivalent to one or two months of the agreed-upon rent. This amount is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy period and is fully refundable upon vacating the premises, provided the property is returned in good condition and all outstanding utility bills have been cleared. Always clarify the exact refund terms and conditions in writing before signing the lease agreement to avoid potential disputes later on."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the standard lease agreement period for a residential rental house",
        "answer": "The most common and legally preferred lease duration for residential rentals in Ambala Cantt is 11 months. This duration ensures the agreement falls under the purview of state rent control acts while also allowing landlords flexibility. After the initial term, the lease can typically be renewed for another 11-month period, subject to mutual agreement between the tenant and the property owner. Longer leases, such as 18 or 24 months, can also be negotiated for specific independent houses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are houses for rent generally furnished semi-furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "The availability varies significantly across Ambala Cantt. Most budget-friendly houses for rent are offered unfurnished, requiring tenants to provide all necessary items. Semi-furnished units often include essential fixtures like ceiling fans, light fittings, geysers, and modular kitchen setups. Fully furnished houses are available, primarily targeting executives or short-term tenants, but these command a premium rental rate due to the added convenience and inventory provided."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to prepare when applying for a rental house",
        "answer": "Landlords typically require comprehensive documentation for verification purposes. You should prepare copies of your Photo ID proof such as Aadhar Card or Passport, current address proof, and proof of employment or income stability, often including recent salary slips or bank statements. Defense personnel may require an official posting order. Additionally, two passport-sized photographs are usually mandatory for inclusion in the formal rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it common to include maintenance charges in the monthly rent",
        "answer": "In independent houses or older properties, the tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs and standard utility bills, and maintenance is not bundled into the rent. However, if you rent a house or flat within a Gated Community or modern society complex in Ambala Cantt, a specific monthly maintenance charge is often mandatory. This charge covers common area upkeep, security services, and utility backup generators, and is paid either directly to the RWA or sometimes included in the landlord's total rental demand."

        "question": "Can I find pet-friendly houses for rent in the Cantonment area",
        "answer": "Finding a pet-friendly House For Rent in Ambala Cantt can be challenging but it is certainly possible. Independent houses or ground-floor units are more likely to accept pets than high-rise apartments or managed societies due to fewer restrictions. It is essential to declare your pet upfront during negotiations. Landlords who agree to pets often require an increased security deposit to cover potential damages, which should be clearly stipulated in the lease."
