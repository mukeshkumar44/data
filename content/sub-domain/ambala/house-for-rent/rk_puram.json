    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a rental house in RK Puram",
        "answer": "Generally, landlords in RK Puram require a security deposit equivalent to two to three months of the agreed-upon rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all dues are cleared. High-end or fully furnished properties might sometimes request a slightly higher deposit, but this will be clearly stated in the rental agreement drafted before you commit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are brokerage charges mandatory when finding a rental home in RK Puram",
        "answer": "Yes, standard practice in the RK Puram rental market involves paying a brokerage fee to the property consultant who facilitates the transaction. This fee is typically equivalent to one month's rent. Our fees are transparently communicated, and this payment covers all services including property shortlisting, viewing coordination, negotiation, and detailed lease documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the monthly rent price for a House For Rent in RK Puram",
        "answer": "Several factors dictate the rental value. Key influences include the size and configuration of the house (BHK count), whether it is furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished, the age of the construction, proximity to essential services like the metro station or main markets, and the specific sector within RK Puram. Properties with dedicated parking or power backup systems command a premium rental rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lease duration for residential properties in RK Puram",
        "answer": "The standard lease agreement for a House For Rent in RK Puram is 11 months. This is common practice to avoid registration hassles required for leases exceeding 12 months. Most landlords are open to renewing the lease after the initial 11-month period, often with a slight annual increase in rent, which is usually pre-agreed upon in the initial contract terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is documentation mandatory for tenancy registration in this area",
        "answer": "Yes, proper documentation is mandatory and legally required. You will need proof of identity and address, such as an Aadhar Card and PAN card. The lease agreement should be properly notarized or registered depending on the duration and mutual agreement. We assist tenants and landlords in ensuring all necessary legal formalities are completed smoothly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I find fully furnished houses for rent in RK Puram easily",
        "answer": "Yes, while semi-furnished properties are very common, there is a growing supply of fully furnished houses, especially 1 BHK and 2 BHK units catering to expatriates or corporate tenants. Fully furnished rentals include key appliances, furniture, and sometimes even kitchenware. These command higher rents but offer maximum convenience for immediate move-in."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the policy regarding maintenance charges in RK Puram rental houses",
        "answer": "For independent houses, maintenance responsibilities for minor repairs usually fall on the tenant, while structural or major repairs are the landlord's duty. In gated societies, tenants are typically responsible for paying monthly society maintenance charges directly to the Residents Welfare Association RWA for common area upkeep, which is separate from the base rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the connectivity and transport network from RK Puram for daily commuting",
        "answer": "RK Puram boasts excellent connectivity. It is served by a dedicated Delhi Metro station on the Magenta Line, providing quick access to key employment hubs like Hauz Khas and Kalkaji. The area is also well-connected by DTC bus routes and is centrally located with easy driving access to South Delhi and Central Delhi areas, making commuting very manageable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific rules concerning house modifications or alterations for tenants",
        "answer": "Tenants are generally not allowed to make structural modifications to the House For Rent in RK Puram without explicit written permission from the landlord. Minor cosmetic changes like painting or hanging art are usually permitted, but it is always best practice to seek approval first to avoid deposit deductions or disagreements upon vacating the premises."
      },
      {
        "question": "What essential amenities should I look for when renting an older property in RK Puram",
        "answer": "When renting an older property, prioritize essentials like reliable water supply especially during summer, adequate parking availability if needed, functional wiring and plumbing systems, and security measures like reinforced doors or access control. While they may lack modern luxury, their large sizes and excellent locations often make them appealing rental choices."
