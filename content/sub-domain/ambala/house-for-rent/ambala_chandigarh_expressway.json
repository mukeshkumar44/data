    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit requirement for houses for rent in this area",
        "answer": "The standard practice for rental properties along the Ambala Chandigarh Expressway Ambala is typically a security deposit equivalent to two to three months' rent. This deposit is refundable upon the satisfactory conclusion of the lease period, assuming no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear has occurred. Specific deposit amounts can vary based on whether the property is fully furnished or unfurnished and the landlord's individual policy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the rental houses on the Ambala Chandigarh Expressway primarily furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "The inventory features a healthy mix of both options to cater to diverse tenant needs. Unfurnished properties are usually the most common, allowing tenants to bring their own furniture. However, we also maintain a curated selection of semi-furnished homes (with essentials like modular kitchen, wardrobes, and light fixtures) and fully furnished units, which are particularly popular among expatriates and corporate tenants seeking immediate move-in capability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accessible are basic amenities like water supply and power backup in these rental communities",
        "answer": "The communities and townships along the Expressway are known for their robust infrastructure. Most properties offer 24/7 dedicated water supply, and the majority of gated communities include full power backup systems, either via common area generators or individual unit inverter systems, ensuring minimal disruption during utility outages which provides significant peace of mind."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a House For Rent in Ambala Chandigarh Expressway",
        "answer": "The typical rental agreement in the region includes a lock-in period of six months. This means that neither the tenant nor the landlord can prematurely terminate the lease during this initial period without incurring a penalty, usually the forfeiture of the security deposit or equivalent rent amount. Lease terms become more flexible after the initial lock-in duration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in the rental houses located along the Expressway",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by the landlord or the respective society management committee. While some independent houses are pet-friendly, many gated communities impose restrictions on the size or type of pets allowed. We advise tenants to communicate their pet requirements upfront so we can filter listings to those with approved pet policies."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often is the rent reviewed or increased during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "In line with standard regional rental practices, rent revision usually occurs annually upon the renewal of the lease agreement. The typical annual increase ranges between 5% and 10%, depending on current market inflation and specific terms agreed upon in the initial rental contract. All revision clauses are clearly outlined in the tenancy agreement documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to finalize a rental agreement for these properties",

Police verification is mandatory for all tenants residing in Ambala and our team assists in filing the necessary documentation for this process seamlessly."
      },
      {

In gated societies, one or two designated parking spots are usually allocated per rental unit, depending on the size of the house and the community regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common extra monthly charges besides the rent",
        "answer": "Beyond the basic monthly rent, tenants are usually responsible for utility bills such as electricity, water usage, and gas. If the property is located in a gated community, a monthly maintenance charge is also applicable, covering common area upkeep, security services, and community amenities access."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I view properties virtually before scheduling an in-person visit",
