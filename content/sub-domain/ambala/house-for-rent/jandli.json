This variation depends significantly on factors such as the house's age, whether it is semi-furnished or unfurnished, proximity to the main road or highway, and the specific amenities provided like dedicated parking or modular kitchen fittings.

        "question": "Are independent houses or apartments more common for rent in Jandli",
        "answer": "Jandli is predominantly a residential area characterised by independent houses and builder floors rather than high-rise apartment complexes common in metropolitan cities. This offers renters more privacy, potentially greater space, and often a small dedicated outdoor area. Independent houses for rent are therefore the most common property type available appealing greatly to families seeking a traditional and spacious living environment near Ambala."
