        "answer": "Yes, paying a security deposit is standard practice for securing a shop for rent in Sector 21 and across Rohtak. The deposit usually ranges from 3 to 6 months' worth of rent, depending on the property owner and the size of the rental unit. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition and all rent and utility dues are cleared. Always ensure the security deposit amount and refund terms are clearly documented in the lease agreement."

      {
        "question": "Is parking available for commercial shop tenants and customers in Sector 21",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies greatly depending on the specific location of the shop.

        "question": "Are property taxes and maintenance costs included in the shop rental price",
        "answer": "Generally, property taxes are the responsibility of the property owner and are not included in the shop rental price. However, maintenance costs are usually handled in two ways. For individual shops, the tenant is typically responsible for internal repairs and utilities. For shops located in commercial complexes, a separate Common Area Maintenance CAM charge is levied monthly which covers shared services like security, lift maintenance, and common area cleaning. Clarify this distinction before finalising the shop for rent in Sector 21."

        "question": "How soon can I occupy a shop after finalising the lease agreement",

If the shop for rent is ready-to-move and requires minimal modifications, you can often take possession within 1 to 3 days after signing the lease and paying the security deposit. If significant renovations or government approvals are needed for your business type, the occupancy period may extend to 4 to 6 weeks. Our agents can help expedite all documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate the shop space after taking it on rent in Sector 21",
        "answer": "Renovations and modifications are typically permitted but must be clearly outlined and approved by the owner in the lease agreement. Most owners allow cosmetic changes like painting, flooring updates, and installation of internal fixtures. Structural changes, however, are usually strictly prohibited unless explicitly agreed upon. Always secure written permission for any significant modification before investing in the shop for rent to avoid future disputes with the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 21 considered a premium or affordable area for commercial rentals in Rohtak",
        "answer": "Sector 21 is positioned as a prime commercial area in Rohtak offering a balance between premium location benefits and competitive pricing. While rental costs are higher than in older, congested market areas, the superior infrastructure, planned environment, and high commercial viability justify the investment.
