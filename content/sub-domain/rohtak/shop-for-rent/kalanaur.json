    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a shop for rent in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Standard practice for commercial rentals in Kalanaur usually requires a security deposit equivalent to 3 to 6 months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the lease period and is refundable upon vacating the premises provided all terms of the lease regarding property condition are met and no outstanding bills remain. Always clarify the exact amount and conditions for release in the registered lease agreement before committing to the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility connections included with the commercial rental space",
        "answer": "Generally utility connections like electricity and water supply are available but the cost of consumption is the responsibility of the tenant. Tenants are usually required to transfer the electricity meter into their name and handle monthly payments directly with the service provider. Ensure you verify the sanctioned load of the electricity connection to adequately meet your specific business operational needs like high-power machinery or large air conditioning units."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for commercial shops in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Most commercial leases in Kalanaur are structured for a minimum lock-in period of 1 to 3 years followed by renewable options usually set for subsequent 1 or 2 year terms. Longer lease terms often 5 years or more are common for established businesses like banks or large showrooms offering greater stability and security for significant business investment and interior fit-outs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I make modifications or renovations to the rented shop space",
        "answer": "Modifications are typically allowed but only with the express written consent of the landlord clearly documented in the lease contract. Minor cosmetic changes like painting are often acceptable. Major structural changes or alterations to the facade require specific clauses in the lease agreement and often mandatory restoration of the property to its original condition upon lease termination unless otherwise negotiated."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the rent escalation or increase handled in Kalanaur commercial leases",
        "answer": "Rent escalation clauses are standard and ensure fairness against market fluctuations. Typically the rent is increased by a fixed percentage commonly 5% to 10% every 12 to 36 months depending on the length of the lease agreement and prevailing market conditions. This percentage and the exact timeline must be clearly defined and mutually agreed upon before signing the commercial contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a Goods and Services Tax GST registration to rent a shop",
        "answer": "If your business turnover exceeds the current GST threshold or if the landlord is GST registered and charging GST on the rent you may need a GST registration number. It is advisable to consult a tax professional to ensure full compliance regarding rental payments and input tax credits for your business operation in Kalanaur especially if dealing with large commercial transactions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the rental price of a shop in Kalanaur Rohtak",
        "answer": "Key factors include the location's proximity to main roads or residential areas the available frontage and visibility of the shop the total area in square feet the floor level and the quality of construction and available amenities such as dedicated parking security provisions and elevator access for upper floors. Prime ground-floor shops facing the main road command the highest rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to terminate the commercial lease early",
        "answer": "Early termination is usually governed by a specific clause within the lease agreement. Most leases enforce a penalty often the forfeiture of the security deposit or the payment of the remaining rent for the lock-in period specified in the contract. Clear communication and adherence to the notice period specified in the agreement usually 3 months are mandatory to minimize financial penalties."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there stamp duty requirements for commercial leases in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Yes commercial lease agreements exceeding 11 months must be formally registered with the local registrar and require payment of applicable stamp duty and registration fees as per Haryana state government rules. We assist in ensuring the correct legal process is followed for your commercial rental agreement to make it legally binding and verifiable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where are the most affordable areas to find a shop for rent in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Generally properties slightly away from the highly concentrated Main Bazaar or located on the upper floors of commercial complexes tend to offer more competitive pricing. Areas closer to newly developed residential extensions rather than the established central market often provide lower entry costs suitable for startups and budget-conscious entrepreneurs willing to develop a new customer base."
