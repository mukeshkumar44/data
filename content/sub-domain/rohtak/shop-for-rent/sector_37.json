A medium-sized shop typically between 500 to 800 square feet on the ground floor near the main commercial stretch can currently range from INR 25000 to INR 45000 per month.

      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period required for commercial leases in Sector 37",
        "answer": "Landlords in Sector 37 usually require a mandatory lock-in period for commercial properties to ensure rental stability and minimize tenant turnover expenses. This period typically ranges from 12 to 36 months depending on the size of the shop and the investment made by the landlord in modifications or custom fitting. Breaking the lease during this lock-in period usually results in the forfeiture of the security deposit or payment of a penalty equivalent to the remaining rent period."

      {
        "question": "Is security deposit negotiable when I shop for rent in this area",
        "answer": "Yes the security deposit is often negotiable but standard practice in Sector 37 dictates a deposit equivalent to three to six months of rent. For premium properties or those requiring substantial renovation work the landlord might request six months. Strong tenants with proven business stability however sometimes successfully negotiate this down to three months. Our experts specialize in leveraging tenant profiles to secure favorable deposit terms."

        "answer": "Yes all commercial establishments must adhere to local municipal fire and safety regulations.

      {
        "question": "Are new commercial developments expected soon that might affect current rental values",

        "answer": "Generally minor non-structural renovations are permitted with written consent from the landlord.
