    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical lease terms for a shop for rent in Sector 36 Rohtak",
        "answer": "Typical commercial lease agreements in Sector 36 usually range from 3 to 5 years, with standard clauses for a rental increment every 11 to 12 months. Landlords often prefer longer lock-in periods, usually 18 to 36 months, particularly for large retail spaces or restaurants that require significant interior customization. We advise tenants to carefully review the force majeure clauses and maintenance responsibilities before signing to ensure the terms meet their long-term business continuity plans."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the foot traffic compare in Sector 36 versus older Rohtak markets",
        "answer": "Sector 36 benefits from being a planned sector adjacent to growing residential colonies, meaning the foot traffic is often derived from affluent, captive local residents seeking convenience and modern shopping experiences. While older markets might have higher density traffic, Sector 36 offers higher quality, targeted traffic and better infrastructure, including wider walkways and organized parking, which is increasingly preferred by modern consumers and high-end retail brands."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utilities are usually included in the rent when leasing a commercial space",
        "answer": "Generally, commercial rental agreements in Sector 36 Rohtak only include the bare shell space and property taxes paid by the landlord. Utilities such as electricity, water usage, internet connectivity, and maintenance of shared common areas (CAM charges) are typically paid separately by the tenant. It is crucial to clarify the sanctioned electrical load capacity of the shop to ensure it meets the requirements of your specific business equipment before finalizing the deal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there restrictions on the type of business I can open in a Sector 36 shop rental",
        "answer": "Yes, zoning regulations apply. Sector 36 commercial spaces are generally designated for retail, F&B establishments, banking, and professional services. However, loud industrial operations or businesses that generate excessive pollution may be restricted, especially those adjacent to residential blocks. We verify the specific zoning permissions for each listed shop to ensure your intended business activity is compliant with local municipal and RERA guidelines before you commit to the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average security deposit required for renting a commercial shop",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for a shop for rent in Sector 36 usually ranges from 3 to 6 months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable upon the satisfactory termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills are cleared. The exact amount often depends on the size of the space and the perceived risk profile of the tenant's business."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is dedicated parking usually available with the shop rental",
        "answer": "Dedicated internal parking spaces are rare for standard small retail units. However, many complexes in Sector 36 provide extensive common area parking or municipal street parking facilities designed to handle high commercial volumes. For larger showroom units, a few reserved basement or ground-level parking spots might be negotiated as part of the rental package. We specify parking availability clearly in our property descriptions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I occupy a vacant shop space in Sector 36",
        "answer": "Occupation time depends largely on the readiness of the space and the speed of legal processing. If the shop is a newly built bare shell, possession can be granted immediately upon signing the lease and submitting the security deposit. If minor customizations or tenant improvements are needed, the landlord may grant a rent-free fit-out period, typically ranging from 30 to 60 days, to allow you time to prepare the space for commercial use."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors primarily influence the rent price of a shop in this sector",
        "answer": "Several key factors drive rental prices in Sector 36. These include frontage width and visibility on the main road, total carpet area, floor level (ground floor is premium), proximity to major intersections, and the quality of the building's infrastructure (e.g., power backup, elevator access). Shops located on the periphery or without direct road access command significantly lower rents than prime ground-floor units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a real estate agent to secure a commercial rental agreement here",
        "answer": "While not legally mandatory, utilizing a specialized commercial real estate professional is highly recommended. We provide crucial market insights, verify property titles, negotiate favorable rental increments and lock-in periods, and ensure that the lease draft protects your business interests fully. Navigating the complexities of commercial law and local regulations is significantly easier with expert guidance in Sector 36 Rohtak."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the growth outlook for commercial property value in Sector 36",
        "answer": "The growth outlook is highly positive. Sector 36 is part of Rohtak's planned expansion zone, characterized by superior infrastructure and ongoing residential development. This steady influx of residents guarantees increasing demand for services and retail, leading to potential capital appreciation for investors and sustained rental viability for tenants. Securing a shop for rent now positions your business to benefit from this accelerated economic development."
