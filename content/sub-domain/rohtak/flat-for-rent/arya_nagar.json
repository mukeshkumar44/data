    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for Flats For Rent in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit required for rental flats in Arya Nagar usually equates to two months' worth of rent. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the lease term provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are cleared. Some premium or fully furnished units may occasionally request up to three months' rent as a deposit, but this will always be clarified upfront in the initial listing and agreement documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance costs included in the monthly rent for flats in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "Generally, maintenance costs are separate from the base rent. If the flat is part of a cooperative society or apartment complex, a fixed monthly maintenance fee covers shared services like lift operation, common area cleaning, and building security. Individual unit maintenance such as plumbing or electrical repairs inside the flat are usually the tenant’s responsibility unless specified otherwise in the lease agreement. We ensure this distinction is clear before lease signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common for rental properties in Arya Nagar Rohtak",

This structure avoids the necessity of registering the lease under state law, simplifying the process for both landlords and tenants. However, longer terms such as one year or two years are negotiable, especially for stable tenants or corporate leases, and these longer leases may require formal registration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it permissible to keep pets in Flats For Rent in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "The pet policy is entirely dependent on the specific landlord and the society rules where the flat is located. While some landlords are strictly against pets, many others permit small house pets such as cats or small dogs, often requiring an additional pet deposit to cover potential damage. We recommend tenants clearly state their need for a pet-friendly flat during the initial search so we can filter suitable listings in Arya Nagar immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close are the rental flats in Arya Nagar to educational institutions like MDU",
        "answer": "Arya Nagar is highly favored due to its excellent proximity to major educational hubs, particularly Maharshi Dayanand University MDU. Many of our listed Flats For Rent are within a short 10 to 15-minute commuting distance, making them extremely convenient for students and faculty members. This proximity is a significant factor contributing to the demand for rental properties in the area."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for utility payments like electricity and water in the rental flats",
        "answer": "In almost all cases for Flats For Rent in Arya Nagar, the tenant is responsible for paying their own utility bills, including electricity, water usage above any included limits, and gas connection charges. Tenants usually receive bills directly from the service providers. We assist with the transfer of meter names where necessary to ensure smooth transition and accurate billing during your tenancy period."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet my rented flat in Arya Nagar Rohtak",
        "answer": "Subletting is generally prohibited unless explicit written consent is obtained from the landlord and is specifically detailed in the lease agreement. Most residential leases forbid tenants from subleasing the property entirely or partially. If you anticipate needing a flatmate, this must be discussed openly with the landlord before signing the contract to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the procedure for renewal of the lease agreement for rental flats",
        "answer": "We typically initiate the renewal discussion about two months prior to the expiration of the current 11-month lease. The landlord may propose a small rental increase, usually between 5% and 10%, based on prevailing market rates in Arya Nagar. Once terms are agreed upon, a new rental agreement is drafted and signed, ensuring continued hassle-free occupancy of your flat."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required from a tenant to secure a flat for rent",
        "answer": "To secure a flat, prospective tenants generally need to provide government-issued photo identification such as an Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current employment or student status, and bank statements or salary slips for financial verification. For corporate leases, company registration documents are required. These documents help confirm identity and ability to meet rental commitments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do the rental flats in Arya Nagar typically include parking facilities",
