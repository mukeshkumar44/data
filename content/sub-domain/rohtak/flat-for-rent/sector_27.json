      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for flats for rent in Sector 27",
        "answer": "Most landlords in Sector 27 Rohtak typically require a security deposit equivalent to two months of the monthly rent.

We ensure that the terms regarding the return of the security deposit are clearly specified in the rental agreement to protect your interests."

For flats within large organized residential societies or gated communities the monthly rent often excludes specific society maintenance charges which cover common area lighting lift operation and security. These charges are usually paid separately by the tenant directly to the Resident Welfare Association RWA. If you are renting an independent floor or builder flat maintenance is typically handled directly by the landlord or tenant and is rarely included in the base rent price.
