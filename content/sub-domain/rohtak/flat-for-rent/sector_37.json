    "faqs": [
      { "question": "What are the typical rent ranges for flats in Sector 37 Rohtak", "answer": "The rental price in Sector 37 varies significantly based on the configuration, age of the property, and level of furnishing. Generally, a 1 RK unit starts around INR 4,500 to INR 6,500. A standard 2 BHK flat for rent usually ranges between INR 8,000 and INR 12,000 per month, while premium 3 BHK flats in gated communities can command rents from INR 14,000 up to INR 20,000 or more. Location within the sector and proximity to commercial areas also influences the final monthly rental cost." },
      { "question": "Is Sector 37 a safe residential area for families and students", "answer": "Yes, Sector 37 is highly regarded as one of the safer and more organized residential sectors in Rohtak. It benefits from planned infrastructure and active Resident Welfare Associations. The area sees regular police patrolling due to its proximity to the main road and commercial activities. Students and families appreciate the well-lit streets and generally peaceful environment. We recommend looking for flats within societies or builder floors with dedicated security personnel for maximum peace of mind." },
      { "question": "What is the standard security deposit required for renting a flat here", "answer": "In Sector 37 Rohtak, the standard practice is to require a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear. Some landlords might request an additional utility deposit, though this is less common. Always ensure the deposit amount and refund terms are clearly documented in the rental agreement." },
      { "question": "How close are flats in Sector 37 to MD University Rohtak", "answer": "Sector 37 offers excellent proximity to Maharshi Dayanand University MDU, making it exceptionally popular among faculty members and students. Depending on the exact location within the sector, the university is typically a 10 to 15 minute drive or a short rickshaw ride. Many residents find this location ideal because it balances quick access to the campus with slightly better and newer residential infrastructure compared to areas immediately adjacent to the university gates." },
      { "question": "Are water supply and electricity reliable in Sector 37 rental flats", "answer": "Water supply in Sector 37 is generally reliable, managed through a mix of municipal corporation water and private borewells in some independent homes. Most new apartments and complexes offer 24-hour water availability. Electricity supply is standard for Rohtak, but power cuts can occur during peak summer months. Many premium flats for rent in Sector 37 offer inverter backup or generator facilities to ensure continuous power for essential appliances." },
      { "question": "What documents are required to finalize a rental agreement in Sector 37", "answer": "To finalize a lease agreement, tenants typically need to provide valid photo identification proofs such as Aadhar Card, PAN Card, or Passport. Landlords will also require proof of current employment or student enrollment if applicable. A signed rent agreement is mandatory, along with the payment of the first month’s rent and the security deposit. We assist in verifying and organizing all necessary documentation for a seamless process." },
      { "question": "Are maintenance charges usually included in the rent in Sector 37", "answer": "Maintenance charges vary depending on the type of property. For flats located within established residential societies, maintenance fees covering common area cleaning, lift upkeep, and security are usually charged separately, monthly, or quarterly. For independent builder floor flats, the tenant may be responsible for minor maintenance, and the overall maintenance is not typically included in the quoted rent amount unless explicitly stated in the lease agreement." },
      { "question": "Can I find fully furnished flats for rent in Sector 37 Rohtak", "answer": "Yes, there is a good selection of fully furnished flats in Sector 37, though they generally command higher rents. Fully furnished units include essential furniture like beds, wardrobes, dining sets, and often appliances like ACs and geysers. These are highly sought after by professionals or individuals relocating from other cities, as they allow for immediate, hassle-free move-in." },
      { "question": "What is the typical lease duration for rental flats in this sector", "answer": "The most common lease duration for flats for rent in Sector 37 is 11 months. This structure is often used to avoid complex registration requirements that apply to leases exceeding 12 months. However, leases can be renewed upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. Longer lease terms, such as 18 or 24 months, are sometimes negotiated, especially for corporate leases or long-term residents." },
      { "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental properties in Sector 37", "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by individual landlords or the governing Resident Welfare Association RWA of a society. While some independent builder floors may allow small pets with certain conditions and an increased security deposit, many apartment complexes have strict no-pet policies. It is crucial to clarify the pet policy upfront before viewing flats to avoid complications later in the tenancy process." }
