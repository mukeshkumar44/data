    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for Flats For Rent in Sector 3 Rohtak",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 3 usually ranges from one to two months' equivalent rent. This deposit is refundable upon the end of the lease, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond standard wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills have been settled by the tenant. Premium or fully furnished flats might sometimes require a slightly higher deposit, which must be clearly stipulated in the lease agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pet-friendly rental apartments available in Sector 3 and how do I find them",
        "answer": "While Sector 3 is a residential area, not all landlords permit pets, especially in builder floors or multi-unit buildings. Pet-friendly Flats For Rent in Sector 3 are available but require specific searching. We recommend filtering your search results for 'pet-friendly' and always confirming the exact pet policy, including potential pet deposits or restrictions on size or breed, directly with the landlord before committing to a viewing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for rental flats in this area",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration for residential rental apartments in Sector 3 Rohtak is 11 months. This duration is widely preferred because it avoids the mandatory registration requirement associated with leases lasting 12 months or more. However, tenants seeking longer stability may negotiate a full 12 or 24-month registered lease, which offers greater long-term security but involves additional stamp duty costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are maintenance and utility charges usually handled for rented flats in Sector 3",
        "answer": "Generally, tenants are responsible for their own utility bills including electricity, water, and gas connections. Regular monthly maintenance charges for common areas, security, and cleaning are usually either included in the rent or paid separately by the tenant to the Resident Welfare Association or the landlord, depending on the property type. Always clarify the exact scope of maintenance covered before finalizing the rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do I need to prepare before renting a flat in Sector 3 Rohtak",
        "answer": "Prospective tenants should prepare several key documents. These typically include Government-issued photo ID such as Aadhar Card or Passport, current address proof, proof of employment or student status, and often two passport-sized photographs. Landlords may also request police verification details, which is a mandatory requirement for tenancy registration in Rohtak."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average rent range for a 2 BHK flat in Sector 3",
        "answer": "The rent for a 2 BHK flat in Sector 3 Rohtak can vary significantly based on the age of the building, level of furnishing, and exact proximity to the main market or road. Generally, you can expect rents to range between INR 10,000 to INR 18,000 per month. Premium new builder floors or fully furnished units may exceed this range, while older apartments might be more affordable."

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent for Flats For Rent in Sector 3",

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to terminate the lease agreement early",
        "answer": "Early lease termination procedures must be detailed in the agreement. Typically, standard leases include a lock-in period, during which neither party can terminate the agreement. If termination occurs after the lock-in period but before the lease ends, the tenant is usually required to give one or two months' advance notice or forfeit the equivalent amount of rent or a portion of the security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are furnished or semi-furnished flats common in Sector 3 Rohtak rental market",
        "answer": "Both furnished and semi-furnished options are widely available among Flats For Rent in Sector 3.
