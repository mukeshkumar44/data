    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a rental house in Dev Colony",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Dev Colony Rohtak usually ranges between one month and two months worth of the stated rent. This amount is held by the landlord for the duration of the lease to cover potential damages or unpaid rent. It is fully refundable upon the successful completion of the lease term and after a final inspection confirms the property is returned in good condition, allowing for normal wear and tear. Specific deposit requirements are clearly stated in each listing and in the final lease agreement before you sign for your House For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance costs included in the monthly rent for properties in Dev Colony",
        "answer": "Generally, maintenance costs are split between the tenant and the landlord, depending on the nature of the repair and the property type. Routine minor maintenance, such as replacing light bulbs or internal cleaning, is typically the tenant's responsibility. Major structural repairs, external painting, or upkeep of common areas in societies are usually covered by the landlord or a society maintenance fee, which might be separate from the rent. We clarify all maintenance responsibilities before you finalize the rental of your House For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is needed to rent a house in Dev Colony Rohtak",
        "answer": "To secure a House For Rent, you will typically need to provide government-issued photo identification like an Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of employment or student enrollment, and sometimes bank statements or salary slips for verification. If you are an expatriate or non-local resident, additional documentation such as a valid visa or residency proof may be required. We assist in compiling and verifying the necessary paperwork for a quick approval process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the monthly rent or lease duration in Dev Colony",
        "answer": "Yes, rent negotiation is common practice in the Rohtak rental market, especially for longer lease commitments. While the advertised price is generally firm, our expert agents can negotiate on your behalf, particularly if you are willing to sign an 18-month or 24-month lease. The lease duration is also flexible, though 11-month agreements with automatic renewal clauses are most standard for a residential House For Rent in Dev Colony."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental properties in Dev Colony",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords in Dev Colony. While some independent houses are fully pet-friendly, many apartments or builder floors have restrictions due to society rules or proximity to other tenants. If you have pets, it is crucial to filter your search specifically for pet-allowed listings. Often, a higher security deposit or an additional, non-refundable pet fee may be required by the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to break the lease early in Dev Colony",
        "answer": "Lease break clauses are crucial parts of the agreement. Typically, if a tenant breaks the lease before the agreed-upon term expires, they may forfeit the entire security deposit. In some cases, the agreement stipulates that the tenant must continue paying rent until a suitable replacement tenant is found. We strongly advise reviewing the specific early termination clause of your House For Rent lease before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the entire process take from viewing to move-in for a Dev Colony rental",
        "answer": "If you are prepared with all necessary documents and verification is swift, the process can be remarkably fast. We often see tenants move in within 3 to 7 working days from the time they select a property. The key stages involve property viewing, landlord acceptance, document verification, lease drafting, and final signing. Our efficient system ensures minimal delays in securing your House For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a brokerage fee to rent a house through your service",
        "answer": "Yes, standard brokerage fees apply for our professional services, which cover property shortlisting, personalized tours, price negotiation, documentation preparation, and legal vetting of the lease. The typical brokerage fee for securing a House For Rent in Dev Colony Rohtak is equivalent to one month's rent, payable upon successful signing of the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of public transport access is available near Dev Colony properties",
