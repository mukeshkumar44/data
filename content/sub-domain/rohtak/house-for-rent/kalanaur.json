    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for a rental house in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "The standard rental agreement period for residential properties in Kalanaur is typically 11 months. This duration allows the agreement to be registered under the Registration Act while avoiding the higher costs associated with 12-month or multi-year leases. However, based on mutual agreement between the landlord and tenant, longer lease terms of 18 or 24 months can also be negotiated, especially for corporate or long-term family rentals. Always confirm the exact duration and renewal terms before signing the final document."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is usually required for a rental property in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "The security deposit for a House For Rent in Kalanaur Rohtak generally ranges from one to two months' worth of rent. This amount is held by the landlord as security against potential damages to the property or failure to pay the final month's rent. The security deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided the property is vacated in good condition and all utility bills are settled. Premium or fully furnished properties might sometimes require a slightly higher deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses across Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords in Kalanaur. While independent houses sometimes offer more flexibility regarding pets, many apartment complexes have strict no-pet policies due to common area management. It is crucial to clearly communicate your need for a pet-friendly House For Rent upfront during the search process. We maintain a specific filter to help you find listings where pets are explicitly permitted, often requiring an additional non-refundable 'pet deposit'."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is needed to rent a house in the Kalanaur area",
        "answer": "Standard documentation required includes proof of identity such as Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current residence, and proof of income or employment (salary slips or offer letter). Tenants are also typically required to provide photographs and references. For foreign nationals, a valid visa and residential permit are mandatory. Police verification of the tenant is a standard procedure undertaken by the landlord or via the rental agency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for maintenance and repairs in a rented house",
        "answer": "Generally, the responsibility is split. The landlord is responsible for structural repairs and major maintenance issues related to plumbing, electrical wiring, and the overall building structure. The tenant is typically responsible for minor running repairs, like replacing light bulbs, fixing small leaks, or maintenance related to the daily wear and tear of the property. Clear demarcation of responsibilities should be detailed explicitly within the registered lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price listed for a house in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is often possible, especially if you are committing to a longer lease period or if the property has been vacant for some time. Our expert agents facilitate constructive negotiations between you and the property owner. The willingness to negotiate depends heavily on current market demand, the specific property’s condition, and its location within Kalanaur."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the entire rental process usually take from viewing to moving in",
        "answer": "If you have all documentation ready, the process can be completed relatively quickly. Typically, once a suitable House For Rent is selected in Kalanaur, the documentation, lease preparation, police verification, and key handover usually take between three to seven working days. Using a professional agency streamlines this process considerably, avoiding unnecessary delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utilities am I responsible for as a tenant in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "As a tenant, you are usually responsible for all utility consumption charges including electricity, water, gas if applicable, and any personal services like internet and DTH connection. It is important that meter readings are recorded accurately on the day of taking possession, and utility connections are transferred to the tenant's name where possible to ensure clear billing during the tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there fully furnished House For Rent options available in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Yes, fully furnished houses and apartments are available, particularly catering to corporate tenants or individuals seeking immediate occupancy without the need to purchase furniture. These properties come equipped with essential appliances, beds, seating, and kitchenware. Naturally, fully furnished rentals command a premium price and often require a higher security deposit compared to unfurnished options."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the notice period required when vacating a rental house",
        "answer": "The standard notice period for termination of a rental agreement by either the tenant or the landlord is usually one month (30 days). This period is specified in the lease agreement and must be adhered to. Failure to provide adequate notice may result in the forfeiture of a portion of the security deposit, as outlined in the terms of your contract for the House For Rent in Kalanaur."
