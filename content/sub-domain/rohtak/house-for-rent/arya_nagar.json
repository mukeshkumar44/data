    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit amount required for a House For Rent in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Arya Nagar Rohtak usually ranges from one to two months’ rent, depending on the type of property and the landlord’s policy. For fully furnished units or premium independent houses, landlords may request a two-month deposit due to the added maintenance liability of the included inventory. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond standard wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills have been cleared."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for rental agreements in this area",
        "answer": "The most common and preferred lease duration for a House For Rent in Arya Nagar is 11 months. This duration is beneficial for both tenants and landlords as it avoids the lengthy and expensive process of registering a one-year-plus lease under the Registration Act, minimizing stamp duty charges. If you require a longer tenure, such as 24 months, a formal registered lease agreement becomes mandatory, which our team can facilitate efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Arya Nagar Rohtak",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly across different properties in Arya Nagar. Independent houses often have a higher likelihood of permitting pets compared to builder floors or apartments in gated complexes, which sometimes have strict association rules against animals. It is crucial to inform us about your pet requirement beforehand so we can specifically filter for pet-friendly Houses For Rent and negotiate a clear clause in the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance during the tenancy period",
        "answer": "Typically, the tenant is responsible for minor repairs and day-to-day maintenance, such as fixing lightbulbs, minor plumbing blockages, or pest control. The landlord is responsible for structural repairs, major electrical faults, waterproofing, and maintaining the exterior of the House For Rent. All responsibilities are explicitly detailed in the lease agreement to prevent any future misunderstandings regarding repair costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a House For Rent after finalizing the agreement",
        "answer": "If the property is vacant and key handover is immediate, you can generally move in within 24 to 48 hours after the lease signing and deposit transfer. However, if police verification or utility transfer requires processing, it may take up to 3 to 5 business days. We streamline the documentation process to minimize this waiting period for your convenience."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do I need to provide as a prospective tenant in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "Landlords typically require comprehensive documentation for background and identity verification. This usually includes Aadhar Card copy, PAN Card copy, proof of current employment or student enrollment, and sometimes bank statements or salary slips. For tenants moving to Rohtak from other cities, a reference check from a previous landlord may also be requested to ensure compliance and security."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any additional monthly or annual charges beyond the basic rent",
        "answer": "Yes, beyond the monthly rent, tenants are usually responsible for all utility costs including electricity, water, and gas usage. In some apartment buildings within Arya Nagar, a nominal monthly maintenance or society fee might also be charged for common area upkeep and security services. These extra charges are always clearly itemized before you commit to the House For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are rent increases handled upon lease renewal in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "Rent escalation clauses are standard in Rohtak rental agreements. For a typical 11-month lease, rent is usually reviewed and increased only upon renewal, often by an agreed-upon percentage, typically between 5% to 10% of the current monthly rent. This mechanism ensures fairness and predictability for both the property owner and the tenant renting the house."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet a room in my rented house in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "Subletting is strictly prohibited unless expressly permitted in writing by the landlord within the rental agreement. Most landlords of independent Houses For Rent in Arya Nagar prefer direct tenancy and prohibit subletting to maintain control over who occupies their property. Violating this clause can lead to immediate termination of your lease and forfeiture of your security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the best time of year to find affordable rental homes in Arya Nagar",
        "answer": "The rental market tends to peak in demand around the start of the academic year (June to August) due to MDU admissions, making prices slightly higher. The quietest periods are typically December through February. Searching for a House For Rent in Arya Nagar during the lower demand seasons may offer better negotiating leverage on the monthly rent."
