      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 35 considered a safe locality for families and children",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 35 is widely recognized as one of the safest and most well-maintained residential sectors in Rohtak. It features organized layouts, good street lighting, and proactive community management. Many of the available houses for rent are located near or within guarded pockets, providing an added layer of security. The sector is less densely populated than older city areas, contributing to a tranquil and secure environment ideal for families seeking peace of mind."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the standard lease terms required for rental properties here",
        "answer": "Most independent house rentals in Sector 35 Rohtak follow a standard 11-month renewable lease agreement. Landlords typically require a security deposit equivalent to two months' rent, which is refundable upon lease termination, assuming no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear. Longer leases, such as 24 months, can often be negotiated for tenants seeking greater stability, sometimes with clauses for fixed annual rent increases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses for rent in Sector 35 typically furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "You will find a mix, but the majority of independent houses listed for rent in Sector 35 are semi-furnished or unfurnished. Semi-furnished homes usually include permanent fixtures like geysers, light fittings, fans, and modular kitchen setups. Fully furnished options are available but are less common and command a significantly higher premium due to the inclusion of furniture, appliances, and necessary white goods required for immediate occupancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the process take to secure a house for rent through your agency",
        "answer": "The entire process, from initial inquiry to receiving the keys, typically takes between one week and ten days. This timeframe allows for necessary steps including property viewing, background verification checks on both tenant and landlord, negotiation of final terms, and execution of the legal paperwork including stamping and registration of the lease deed. Our focus on efficiency minimizes any unnecessary delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility expenses are tenants typically responsible for in a rental house",
        "answer": "In almost all cases of house rentals in Sector 35 Rohtak, the tenant is responsible for all monthly utility consumption charges. This includes electricity based on meter reading, water charges if applicable (some sectors rely on shared connections), cooking gas supply, and internet or cable connections. Property tax, major structural insurance, and major repairs remain the exclusive responsibility of the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Sector 35 suffer from water or electricity supply issues",
        "answer": "Sector 35 generally enjoys excellent infrastructural support compared to developing areas of Rohtak. While brief, scheduled power cuts can occur during peak summer months, most premium independent houses are equipped with dedicated power backup or inverter provisions. Water supply is typically reliable, relying either on municipal lines or private borewells provided by the house owner as a supplemental source."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in Sector 35 if I own pets",
        "answer": "Finding a pet-friendly house for rent can be slightly challenging but is certainly possible in Sector 35. Independent house owners are often more amenable to pets than apartment complexes due to the lack of shared common spaces. It is essential to declare your pets upfront during negotiations, as landlords may require an additional non-refundable pet deposit or a specific clause in the lease agreement concerning noise control and maintenance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the maintenance charges associated with renting an independent house",
        "answer": "Unlike apartments in complexes, independent houses typically do not incur mandatory monthly common area maintenance charges. Tenants are generally responsible for internal minor maintenance like fixing small plumbing leaks, electrical repairs, and routine house cleaning. Major structural or exterior repairs remain the landlord's duty. The lease agreement always clearly outlines who is financially responsible for significant tasks like roof maintenance or motor replacement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is proximity to public transport when looking for a rental house here",
        "answer": "Proximity to public transport is moderately important, depending on your daily commute requirements. Sector 35 is well-served by local auto-rickshaws and shared transport services connecting efficiently across Rohtak. While it does not have a dedicated metro station, its strategic road access facilitates easy connection to major city points and the nearby national highway, ensuring multiple commuting options are always available."
