    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the current average price trend for residential plots handled by Real Estate Agents in Sector 21 Rohtak",
        "answer": "Property values in Sector 21 have shown stable appreciation, particularly for plots near main sector roads and green belts. While prices fluctuate based on specific location, facing, and size, the current average rate per square yard for standard residential plots generally falls within a competitive range compared to surrounding sectors. Factors like clear title documentation and immediate possession availability significantly influence the final selling price. We recommend a consultation for the most precise, up-to-date valuation based on recent registry data."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify the legal status and ownership of a plot in Sector 21",
        "answer": "Legal due diligence is paramount. Our Real Estate Agents in Sector 21 manage this process comprehensively. We verify the revenue records, check for encumbrances, confirm clear title via the Registrar’s office, and ensure the property has necessary approvals from the Town and Country Planning Department Rohtak. We provide you with a comprehensive legal opinion confirming the seller’s right to transfer the property before any earnest money is exchanged."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific construction or height restrictions for plots in Sector 21",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 21, being a planned urban area in Rohtak, adheres strictly to municipal bye-laws regarding Floor Area Ratio FAR and building height limitations. Typically, residential plots allow for construction up to G plus 3 floors, depending on the specific plot size and sanctioned layout. Setback rules also apply to maintain infrastructure integrity. We provide detailed architectural guidelines relevant to your specific plot dimensions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical transaction costs beyond the plot price when buying in Rohtak",
        "answer": "Buyers must account for several costs in addition to the base plot price. These typically include stamp duty charges, registration fees, legal consultation fees, and the agency commission. Stamp duty rates are mandated by the state government and can vary slightly. We provide a full cost breakdown projection early in the process so you can budget accurately without any financial surprises."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between freehold and leasehold property status in Sector 21",
        "answer": "Almost all residential plots within established HUDA sectors like Sector 21 Rohtak are offered on a freehold basis, meaning the buyer acquires permanent, absolute ownership of the land and any structures built upon it. Leasehold properties, which are less common here, involve ownership for a fixed period. We exclusively deal with clear title freehold properties to ensure maximum investment security for our clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the entire property transaction process usually take in Sector 21",
        "answer": "The timeline varies depending on the complexity of the legal documentation and the financing involved. If the buyer is using a home loan, the process can take between 45 to 60 days from agreement to final registry. For direct cash transactions where documents are readily available, the process can be expedited to as quickly as 3 to 4 weeks. Our agents proactively manage all timelines to prevent unnecessary delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get financing or a home loan for purchasing a residential plot here",
        "answer": "Yes, major financial institutions and banks readily offer loans for the purchase of residential plots in approved sectors like Sector 21 Rohtak, provided the property has a clear title and falls within the bank’s lending criteria. We maintain strong relationships with leading banks and can facilitate faster loan approvals and favorable interest rates for our clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to buy a ready-to-move-in house or a vacant plot for investment",
        "answer": "Both options have merits. Buying a vacant plot in Sector 21 offers greater flexibility for custom construction and potentially higher capital appreciation over the long term, especially if the location is prime. A ready-to-move-in house provides immediate occupancy and rental income but involves higher upfront costs. Our agents analyze your investment goals to recommend the superior option."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can an agent help me negotiate the price of property in Sector 21",

We handle the difficult conversations, ensuring that your offer is attractive but also aligns with fair market value, often saving our clients significantly more than the cost of our service."
