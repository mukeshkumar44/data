    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical commission fee structure for real estate agents in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "The commission structure for real estate agents in Kalanaur is generally negotiable but typically adheres to local market standards. For outright sale or purchase of plots and homes, the fee usually ranges from 1% to 2% of the total transaction value, paid by one or both parties depending on the agreement. For rental properties, the standard fee is one month's rent. Transparency is key, and we always outline all costs clearly in our agreement before proceeding with any services."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the average property registration process take in Kalanaur Rohtak",
        "answer": "The duration of the property registration process can vary based on the readiness of documents and the current workload at the Registrar's office in Rohtak. Generally, once the sale deed is prepared and stamp duty is paid, the physical registration process takes a few hours on the appointed day. However, the preparatory stage, including title search and due diligence handled by our agents, can take 10 to 15 working days to ensure all paperwork is legally sound."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific restrictions on buying agricultural land near Kalanaur for non-agriculturists",
        "answer": "Yes, Haryana state laws, which apply to Kalanaur, often impose restrictions on the purchase of agricultural land by non-agriculturists, particularly if the land is outside specific urban zones or does not meet certain minimum area requirements. Our real estate agents specialize in verifying the current land-use classification and ensuring compliance with local laws, guiding investors toward legally convertible land or properties within municipal limits if their intention is non-agricultural use."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is crucial before purchasing a residential plot through a Kalanaur agent",
        "answer": "Before finalizing any purchase, several key documents must be verified. These include the Title Deed proving seller ownership, the Mutation Record (Jamabandi) updated with current details, the No Objection Certificate (NOC) from relevant authorities if required, and a detailed map (Aks Shajra) showing plot boundaries. Our agents meticulously review all previous sale deeds and ensure property tax receipts are up-to-date."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I verify the current market rate for property in specific sectors of Kalanaur",
        "answer": "Verifying the current market rate requires analyzing recent comparable sales (comps) in the specific sector of Kalanaur, alongside the official government collector rate (Circle Rate). Our real estate agents provide a detailed market analysis report, factoring in infrastructure quality, proximity to amenities, and future development potential, giving you a precise and justifiable valuation for buying or selling."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between free hold and lease hold property ownership in Kalanaur",
        "answer": "In Kalanaur, most residential plots sold are Freehold, meaning the owner has full, perpetual rights over the land and the structure built upon it, and the transfer of ownership is simpler. Leasehold property involves leasing the land for a fixed period (e.g., 99 years), and the rights are subject to lease terms. Our agents primarily deal in verified Freehold properties, ensuring maximum security and control for our clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I invest in commercial property in Kalanaur through your real estate agents",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Kalanaur's strategic location on the Rohtak road corridor makes it excellent for commercial investment. We handle commercial plots, shops, and office spaces. Our services include finding properties with high foot traffic, checking zoning regulations for commercial use, and projecting potential rental yields for retail or warehouse operations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do your Kalanaur agents handle property disputes or legal issues during a transaction",
        "answer": "Our primary goal is to prevent disputes through comprehensive due diligence and clear contractual agreements. If any pre-existing legal issues, such as boundary disputes or heir claims, are identified, we immediately notify the client and engage our legal team to advise on mitigation strategies or suspension of the deal until the matter is definitively resolved by the seller. We protect you from inherited legal complications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the hidden costs associated with property buying in Kalanaur apart from the sale price",
        "answer": "Beyond the basic sale price, buyers in Kalanaur must budget for Stamp Duty and Registration Fees, which are state-mandated taxes typically around 6% to 8% of the transaction value. Other costs may include transfer fees, maintenance charges (if applicable in a colony), and our professional service charges. We provide an exhaustive breakdown of all costs upfront, so there are no surprises."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer property management services for owners living outside Kalanaur Rohtak",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer comprehensive property management services ideal for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) or investors residing outside Kalanaur. This includes tenant finding and vetting, rent collection, property maintenance supervision, utility bill payment, and periodic inspections, ensuring your asset is protected and generating steady income without requiring your physical presence."
