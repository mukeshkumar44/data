We check the property's complete chain of title deeds, verify the registered owner with the revenue department, ensure there are no existing mortgages or liens, and check for compliance with HUDA/HSVP regulations concerning plot usage and size.

This rigorous legal vetting process protects our clients from future disputes and guarantees a clear transfer of ownership."

        "question": "Are there any specific Vastu or construction regulations for properties in Sector 27",
        "answer": "Yes, while construction is largely governed by municipal bye-laws regarding floor area ratio FAR and height restrictions, many buyers in Sector 27 also prioritize Vastu compliance. Sector 27 is well-planned, offering many north-facing and east-facing plots which are highly sought after for Vastu reasons. Our Real Estate Agents in Sector 27 can specifically filter listings based on Vastu requirements and also connect you with experienced Vastu-compliant builders who are familiar with local regulations in Rohtak."
