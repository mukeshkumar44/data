Generally, 2 BHK flats start from approximately 35 Lakhs, while spacious 3 BHK apartments in modern complexes can range upwards of 60 Lakhs.

        "answer": "When purchasing a resale flat, essential documents include the original Sale Deed, the Encumbrance Certificate EC, the Occupation Certificate OC, the Completion Certificate CC if applicable, and all previous chain documents.
