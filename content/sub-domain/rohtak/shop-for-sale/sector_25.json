    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What documents are required when purchasing a commercial Shop For Sale in Sector 25",
        "answer": "To ensure a smooth transaction, essential documents include the Sale Deed, the Mother Deed which traces the property's ownership history, and the Khata Certificate or equivalent property record showing the property is assessed under your name. Furthermore, you will need the No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from relevant municipal and developmental authorities, especially confirming the property's commercial status. If it is a leasehold property, the lease agreement and transfer documents are also critical. Always work with a legal expert to verify all documents before finalizing the purchase agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 25 a good investment location for rental income from retail shops",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 25 Rohtak is considered an excellent location for maximizing rental income, particularly from retail spaces. The influx of new residential projects and the planned development of institutional areas guarantees a growing captive audience. Retail shops benefit significantly from this demographic expansion, leading to high demand from businesses seeking space, which translates into lower vacancy rates and the potential for annual rental rate escalations above market average. We observe strong interest across all commercial segments here."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical size range for a readily available Shop For Sale in Sector 25",
        "answer": "The available sizes are quite varied to cater to different business needs. You can typically find small commercial units starting from 150 square feet, which are ideal for smaller services or kiosks. Mid-sized retail shops average between 300 to 600 square feet, perfect for standalone retail operations. Larger commercial spaces, often sought after for showrooms or anchor tenancy, can exceed 1000 square feet and sometimes feature double-height ceilings. Availability largely depends on the specific commercial complex or market within Sector 25."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific zoning or regulatory restrictions for commercial properties in this sector",
        "answer": "Yes, commercial properties in Sector 25, being part of a planned development area, are subject to specific zoning regulations set by the concerned development authority. These regulations dictate permissible usage, maximum floor area ratio (FAR), parking requirements, and building height restrictions. It is vital to confirm that the specific Shop For Sale you are interested in adheres to its designated commercial zone status and that your intended business purpose is permitted under local bylaws before making a commitment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does proximity to major roads affect the price of a commercial shop here",
        "answer": "Proximity to major arterial roads significantly and positively impacts the valuation of a commercial shop in Sector 25. Shops located directly facing or within a short distance of main roads benefit from high vehicular visibility and easier customer access, making them premium properties. Such prime locations often command a 15% to 30% price premium compared to shops located inside side alleys or deep within commercial complexes, justifying the higher cost with enhanced business opportunities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I look for regarding property maintenance and management when buying a shop",
        "answer": "When evaluating a commercial Shop For Sale, inspect the quality of the building maintenance, the adequacy of security systems, and the efficiency of shared services like elevators and common area cleanliness. If the shop is part of a complex, review the maintenance charges and the reputation of the RWA or property management company. A well-maintained property reduces future expenditure and ensures the commercial area remains attractive to both tenants and customers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for securing financing or a commercial loan for a shop in Sector 25",
        "answer": "Securing a commercial loan typically requires a higher down payment compared to residential property, often ranging from 20% to 30% of the property value. Banks will assess the shop's potential rental income, your personal credit history, and the overall value and clear title of the property in Sector 25. Prepare documents such as your Income Tax Returns, bank statements, and the property’s legal papers for a smooth and swift loan approval process."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I expect capital appreciation after purchasing a commercial property here",
        "answer": "While real estate appreciation is dependent on market conditions, Sector 25 Rohtak is currently in a strong growth phase due to ongoing infrastructure projects. Investors typically see noticeable capital appreciation within 3 to 5 years. However, high-demand properties like corner shops or those near newly completed residential sectors might show accelerated growth, often yielding significant returns within the initial 2-year period, making the decision to buy a Shop For Sale here opportune."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to buy a ready-to-move-in shop or an under-construction unit in Sector 25",
        "answer": "The choice depends on your investment goals. Ready-to-move-in shops offer immediate rental income and operational certainty but come at a higher cost. Under-construction units are typically priced lower, offering greater potential for capital appreciation upon completion, but involve construction risk and delays. Given the stability of Sector 25’s development, under-construction options offer higher leverage, but if immediate business launch is required, ready units are preferable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who should I contact for reliable legal assistance during the purchase of my Shop For Sale in Sector 25",
