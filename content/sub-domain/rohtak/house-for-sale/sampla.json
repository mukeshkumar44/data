        "answer": "The Sampla residential market predominantly features independent houses ranging from 4 Marla to 14 Marla plots. The most common inventory is the newly built 6 Marla or 8 Marla House For Sale, typically offering a 2 BHK or 3 BHK configuration. Many buyers prefer independent homes here over flats due to the lower property taxes, greater space for parking, and the flexibility to expand vertically in the future, subject to municipal approvals. You can find both single-storey and duplex houses depending on your budget and family requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sampla a good investment location considering its proximity to Rohtak",
        "answer": "Yes, Sampla is highly regarded as an excellent emerging investment location, largely due to its strategic position on the Delhi-Rohtak national highway corridor. While property rates are lower than central Rohtak, the connectivity is superb, attracting industrial development and steady population growth. Investing in a House For Sale in Sampla today offers strong potential for capital appreciation over the next five to seven years as infrastructure projects mature and industrial areas expand toward the town."

        "answer": "The price range for a standard 3 BHK independent house in Sampla varies significantly based on its location, age of construction, and plot size, typically starting around the 35 lakh mark for an 8 Marla basic unit in an established colony. High-end, newly constructed 10 Marla houses near the highway or prime residential sectors can range upwards of 60 to 75 lakhs. We recommend reviewing specific neighborhood rates, as properties closer to the railway station or main market often command a slight premium."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important are clear land titles when buying property in Sampla Rohtak",
        "answer": "Clear and verifiable land titles are absolutely essential when purchasing any House For Sale in Sampla.

The loan amount usually covers 70% to 80% of the property value, depending on the property's legal clearance and the buyer's financial profile.

        "question": "Are new residential colonies being developed near the Sampla Industrial Model Township IMT",
        "answer": "Yes, the proximity to IMT Rohtak and the potential for new industrial units in Sampla are driving the development of several planned residential colonies, often slightly outside the main town area.
