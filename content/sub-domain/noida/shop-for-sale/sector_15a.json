        "answer": "The shop sizes vary significantly, ranging typically from small food court kiosks of 100 sq ft to large showrooms exceeding 5000 sq ft in specialized retail centers.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific legal requirements I should check before buying a commercial shop in Sector 15A Noida",
        "answer": "Yes, due diligence is paramount. You must verify the property’s completion certificate, the occupancy certificate, and ensure the land use is officially designated for commercial activity by the Noida Authority.

Working with a legal expert specializing in Noida commercial real estate is strongly recommended to safeguard your substantial investment."

      {
        "question": "How does the proximity to the Metro station affect the value of a commercial shop here",
        "answer": "Proximity to the Sector 15 Metro Station significantly boosts the commercial value. Metro access drives high pedestrian traffic, making these shops ideal for fast retail, F&B, and convenience stores that thrive on quick accessibility. Shops within a 500-meter radius often command 15-25% higher rental rates and capital values due to guaranteed customer accessibility, which is a major factor for high-quality tenants seeking prime exposure."

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the expected maintenance and operating costs associated with owning a shop here",
        "answer": "Operating costs typically include property taxes, utility charges (electricity, water), and monthly Common Area Maintenance (CAM) fees if the shop is part of a complex. CAM charges cover security, lift operations, common area lighting, and cleaning. These costs vary based on the complex size and quality of management but must be factored into the total investment calculation when assessing the net rental yield."

        "question": "Is it better to buy a ready-to-move shop or an under-construction unit in Sector 15A",
        "answer": "For Sector 15A, which is largely developed and prime, ready-to-move shops are highly preferable. They offer immediate rental returns and eliminate construction risk and timeline uncertainties. While under-construction might offer a slightly lower initial price, the certainty and immediate cash flow from a ready shop in a prime location like Sector 15A often outweigh the potential savings and are ideal for risk-averse investors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for registering a commercial shop transaction in Noida",
        "answer": "The process involves executing the sale deed, paying the required stamp duty and registration fees based on the circle rate or actual market price, whichever is higher, and then submitting the documentation to the Sub-Registrar’s office in Noida. Verification of documents, adherence to all governmental norms, and clear payment trails are mandatory for a successful and legally sound transfer of ownership of a commercial shop for sale in Sector 15A."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I expect to rent out my acquired shop for sale in Sector 15A",
