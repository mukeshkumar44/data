        "answer": "The expected rental yield for commercial shops in prime complexes of Sector 77 typically ranges between 6 percent and 8 percent annually. This figure is significantly higher than the average residential rental yield in the region, which often hovers around 2 percent to 3 percent.

Ensure the project is RERA registered and obtain a clear title search report before finalising the purchase of any shop for sale in Sector 77."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the future commercial viability of Sector 77 evaluated for retail businesses",
        "answer": "The viability is extremely high due to the density of ready-to-move-in residential societies and limited immediate commercial competition offering modern retail environments. The sector serves as a primary retail hub for sectors 75, 76, 78, and surrounding areas. As the local population stabilizes and disposable incomes increase, retail spending in Sector 77 is projected to rise exponentially, guaranteeing long-term viability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common extra charges or hidden costs when buying a new shop",
        "answer": "Beyond the basic property cost, investors should factor in Goods and Services Tax GST, stamp duty and registration fees, preferential location charges PLC if applicable, development charges, and maintenance security deposits. It is crucial to obtain a detailed, all-inclusive pricing schedule from the builder or seller to avoid unforeseen expenses during the final transaction process for your shop for sale in Sector 77."

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I evaluate the best location within a commercial complex for maximum return",
        "answer": "Focus on shops located at the entrance or exit points, corners facing the main road, or units directly visible from the escalator or elevator landings.

Analyzing the proposed floor plan and traffic flow is critical when selecting the best shop for sale in Sector 77 for optimal returns."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for leasing a commercial shop in this area",
        "answer": "Commercial leases in Sector 77 typically involve a lock-in period ranging from 3 years to 5 years, particularly for established brands.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is buying a shop in Sector 77 better than investing in residential property nearby",
