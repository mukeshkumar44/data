        "question": "Are there any risks associated with investing in commercial property off the Yamuna Expressway",
        "answer": "While Sector 150 is near the Yamuna Expressway, its direct connectivity via the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway mitigates speculative risk.

However, the high planned residential density here provides a strong cushion against market downturns, ensuring robust footfall and tenant demand."

        "question": "Is it possible to secure a pre-leased Shop For Sale in Sector 150 and what are the benefits",
        "answer": "Yes, securing a pre-leased shop is highly recommended for investors seeking immediate returns.

Pre-leased options often involve reputable national or international brands, offering greater financial security."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common property taxes or maintenance charges applicable to commercial shops here",
        "answer": "Commercial properties typically incur higher property taxes than residential units, calculated by the Noida Authority based on location and size.

      },
      {
        "question": "Should I invest in ground floor retail or upper floor shops for better rental yield in Sector 150",
        "answer": "Ground floor retail typically offers superior visibility and immediate access, leading to higher per square foot capital values and base rents.

We recommend prioritizing ground floor for maximum capital appreciation."
