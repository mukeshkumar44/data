    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for a residential plot for sale in Sector 94",
        "answer": "The pricing in Sector 94 is highly dependent on the plot size, facing (such as park facing or corner plot), and overall proximity to key amenities or main roads. Being a premium sector adjacent to Delhi, prices are significantly higher than average Noida rates. A 100 Sq Yd plot starts at a certain premium level, with 300 Sq Yd and larger plots commanding significantly higher values. We recommend contacting our specialists for the current, real-time market rates based on specific available inventory."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are plots in Sector 94 freehold or leasehold properties",
        "answer": "Most residential plots offered by the Noida Authority in Sector 94 are allotted on a long-term leasehold basis, typically for 90 or 99 years. However, the operational process allows for complete transfer of ownership rights. It is crucial to verify the specific lease terms and remaining lease duration for any individual plot before finalizing the purchase, ensuring clear transferability to the new buyer."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to purchase a plot in this sector",
        "answer": "The essential documents include the Allotment Letter from the Noida Authority, the Lease Deed, proof of payment for all previous installments, and the Transfer Memorandum. Buyers will also need Aadhar and PAN card copies. Our service ensures a meticulous check of the seller's clear title, No Objection Certificates, and all necessary documentation required for seamless transfer and registration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 94 a safe area for long-term investment and residency",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 94 is considered one of the safest and most elite residential zones in Noida. It benefits from modern infrastructure, strong governance by the Noida Authority, and high-profile residential developments which contribute to enhanced private and public security measures. The appreciation rates suggest excellent long-term capital preservation and growth."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the floor area ratio FAR allowed for construction on these plots",
        "answer": "The permissible Floor Area Ratio in Sector 94 is determined by the specific land use plan and plot size mandated by the Noida Authority, generally allowing for multi-story construction often up to 4 floors plus stilt parking. The FAR calculations are complex and based on current building bylaws. We provide detailed architectural guidance to help you maximize your construction area legally and efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can an NRI buy a plot for sale in Sector 94 Noida",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Non-Resident Indians NRIs and Persons of Indian Origin PIOs are legally permitted to purchase immovable property including residential plots in Sector 94. The transaction process involves adherence to FEMA regulations, including the use of an NRO or NRE account for payment transfers.

      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 94 to the nearest Metro station",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any restrictions on the type of construction allowed on these plots",
        "answer": "Construction must strictly adhere to the Noida Authority's approved building plans, setbacks, height restrictions, and the allocated FAR for the specific plot size. Generally, the plots are designated for residential use only. Commercial activity is prohibited unless the plot is explicitly zoned for mixed-use, which is rare in this high-end residential pocket."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Sector 94 different from other premium sectors like Sector 150 or Sector 44",
        "answer": "Sector 94's key differentiator is its immediate geographical adjacency to Delhi and its established infrastructure. Unlike emerging sectors like 150 which are further down the expressway, Sector 94 is fully developed, enjoys direct DND access, and is surrounded by fully operational high-end commercial and residential landmarks like Supernova. It offers established, instant luxury living."
      },
      {
        "question": "When can I expect possession after purchasing a plot",
        "answer": "If the plot is part of a resale transaction or an old allotment with a registered Lease Deed, possession can often be transferred immediately upon successful registration of the transfer documents. For plots purchased directly from the authority or in a group housing scheme, possession follows the completion of necessary infrastructure, but our current listings focus on ready-to-build, clear possession plots."
