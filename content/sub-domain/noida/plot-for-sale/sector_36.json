        "question": "Is Sector 36 considered a safe investment area in terms of future appreciation",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 36 is highly regarded as a high-potential investment zone due to its location within the expanding urban limit of Noida. The key drivers for appreciation include its proximity to the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, its planned infrastructure development, and the spillover demand from nearby saturated sectors.

        "answer": "The FSI regulations in Sector 36 are governed by the respective planning authority, generally permitting construction of up to three or four floors depending on the specific block and plot size.
