    "description": "We address the most common concerns potential tenants have when searching for residential properties in this prime location to make your renting journey smoother and fully informed.",
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a flat for rent in Sector 120",
        "answer": "Generally, landlords in Sector 120 Noida require a security deposit equivalent to two months’ rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills are cleared. The exact deposit amount can sometimes be negotiated based on the furnishing status of the flat, where fully furnished units might demand a slightly higher deposit due to the inclusion of expensive appliances and furniture."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges usually included in the monthly rent",
        "answer": "In most societies within Sector 120, the maintenance charges are separate from the base rent. These charges cover society services such as common area electricity, lift operation, gardening, security, and cleaning of public spaces. It is crucial to clarify with the landlord or broker whether the quoted rent is inclusive or exclusive of the society maintenance fee before finalizing the agreement, as these charges can vary significantly between different gated communities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the connectivity of Sector 120 to major commercial areas in Noida",
        "answer": "Sector 120 boasts excellent connectivity, making it a highly desirable residential hub. It offers swift access to Sector 62, a major IT and commercial center, via well-maintained road networks. Furthermore, the area is well-connected to the FNG Expressway and the major highways leading to Ghaziabad and Delhi, ensuring an easy commute for professionals working across the NCR region and reducing daily travel time significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of amenities can I expect when renting in Sector 120 societies",
        "answer": "Most residential societies offering a flat for rent in Sector 120 are modern and comprehensive. You can typically expect amenities including 24/7 power backup, high-speed elevators, dedicated car parking, robust security systems with guarded entry, and recreational facilities like clubs, gyms, swimming pools, and sports courts. Always check the specific society details for the exact amenity list and confirm which are included in the maintenance fee."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it easy to find a pet-friendly flat for rent in Sector 120 Noida",
        "answer": "Finding a pet-friendly apartment can be challenging, as many housing societies have strict no-pet policies governed by RWA rules. However, some individual landlords or specific towers within Sector 120 are more flexible and permit small pets. We highly recommend filtering your search specifically for pet-friendly properties and discussing this clearly with the landlord upfront, as it may influence the terms and deposit of the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for rentals in this sector",
        "answer": "The standard lease agreement for residential flats in Sector 120 Noida is 11 months, which is often renewable upon mutual consent of both parties. This duration is legally structured to avoid mandatory registration fees associated with leases exceeding 12 months. Some tenants and landlords may agree upon a 12-month or longer contract, particularly in corporate leases, but this requires additional legal formalities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 120 to Metro stations",
        "answer": "While Sector 120 does not have its own dedicated Metro station immediately adjacent, it is conveniently located near the Blue Line stations such as Sector 52 or Sector 51, typically requiring a short drive or an auto-rickshaw ride of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Future infrastructure developments are continually planned to enhance Metro accessibility further, solidifying its connectivity advantage in Noida and increasing convenience for commuters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rental price for flats in Sector 120",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is common in the Noida rental market, especially for longer leases or flats that have been vacant for some time. We highly recommend understanding the prevailing market rate for similar flats in the chosen society before negotiating. Our expert agents can provide guidance on realistic and successful negotiation strategies based on current demand and property condition to ensure you get the best possible deal."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to secure a rental flat here",
        "answer": "To secure a flat for rent in Sector 120, you typically need essential proofs of identity and address, such as Aadhar Card and PAN Card copies. If you are a working professional, employment proof or an offer letter may also be required by the landlord. For expats, a valid passport and visa documentation are mandatory, alongside the signed rental agreement and initial security deposit receipt."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rented flat in Sector 120",
        "answer": "The move-in timeline largely depends on the property status and the speed of documentation. If the flat is ready-to-move, unoccupied, and the lease terms are quickly agreed upon, occupancy can often be secured within 2 to 7 days after the agreement signing and deposit payment. Unfurnished flats generally offer the fastest move-in process compared to properties requiring minor repairs or deep cleaning prior to handover."
