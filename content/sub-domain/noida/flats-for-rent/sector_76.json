      {
        "question": "Is Sector 76 considered a safe residential area for families and single women",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Sector 76 is one of Noida's established and highly secure residential sectors. The major societies here have robust, multi-tier security systems including gated access, round-the-clock guards, and comprehensive CCTV coverage across parking lots and common towers.

        "answer": "Most modern societies in Sector 76 offer reliable and extensive power backup facilities. While 100% full load backup might incur higher charges, standard agreements usually include backup for common areas, elevators, and essential appliances such as one AC point and limited lighting/fan points within the flat itself.

When searching for a Flat For Rent in Sector 76, it is crucial to clearly state your requirement for a pet-friendly unit upfront so we can filter available listings that comply with the respective society guidelines and landlord preferences."

During this period, neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the contract without facing a penalty, typically the forfeiture of the security deposit or equivalent rent amount.
