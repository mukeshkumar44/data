        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a Flat For Rent in Sector 116",
        "answer": "Generally, the standard practice for rental properties in Sector 116 Noida is a security deposit equivalent to two months worth of rent. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy agreement provided there are no damages to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills have been cleared. However, some premium or fully furnished apartments might request a deposit covering three months rent. We always clarify the exact deposit requirement before you commit to the lease to ensure full transparency during the transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there good options for fully furnished flats available for rent in Sector 116",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 116 is highly popular among expatriates and working professionals, leading to a strong availability of high-quality fully furnished apartments. These units typically include essential furniture like beds, sofas, dining tables, modular kitchens, and sometimes even electronics such as air conditioners and washing machines. Fully furnished flats are ideal for those seeking immediate occupancy without the hassle and cost of relocating heavy furniture, though they usually command a slightly higher rent than semi-furnished or unfurnished options in the same area."

      {
        "question": "How long are standard lease agreements for rental properties in Sector 116",
        "answer": "The most common lease term for a residential Flat For Rent in Sector 116 is 11 months. This duration is advantageous because it avoids the need for formal registration under certain provisions of Indian law, making the documentation process much simpler and less expensive for both the landlord and the tenant. However, longer terms such as 18 or 24 months can be negotiated, especially in corporate leases, and these longer terms usually require mandatory registration at the local registrar's office."

These include electricity charges, water usage charges often collected by the society, piped gas charges if applicable, and internet or DTH services.

        "answer": "Sector 116 benefits from excellent proximity to the current operational metro stations and future expansions. The nearest functional station is usually the Sector 101 or Sector 81 station on the Aqua Line, typically requiring a short drive or a quick ride via auto-rickshaw. Furthermore, the planned Phase III expansion of the metro is expected to bring a station much closer to the heart of Sector 116, further boosting its connectivity and long-term rental value."
