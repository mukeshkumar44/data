    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a Flat For Rent in Sector 145",
        "answer": "Standard practice in Sector 145 Noida dictates that the security deposit generally equates to two months' worth of rent. This amount is refundable upon the successful completion of the lease term, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges usually included in the monthly rent for flats here",
        "answer": "The inclusion of maintenance charges depends entirely on the specific rental agreement drafted by the landlord. In most modern societies in Sector 145, minor society maintenance charges (like common area electricity and security) are borne by the tenant in addition to the rent. However, some premium listings may feature 'all-inclusive' rent where the landlord covers the monthly society maintenance fee. Always clarify whether this is included or separate before finalizing your budget."
