    "faqs": [
      { "question": "What documentation is typically required to rent a flat in Sector 133 Noida", "answer": "To finalize a Flat For Rent in Sector 133, tenants generally need to provide proof of identity such as Aadhaar Card and PAN Card, proof of employment or student status, and bank statements or salary slips for verification. A standard rental agreement drafted on stamp paper, along with police verification, is mandatory before keys are handed over. Always ensure you receive a copy of the fully signed lease agreement." },
      { "question": "What is the standard security deposit amount for rental flats in Sector 133", "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 133 usually ranges from one to three months’ rent, depending on the builder, the furnishing status, and the demand for that specific society. Luxury and fully furnished flats often command a higher deposit. This amount is refundable upon vacating the property, provided there is no damage beyond normal wear and tear and all dues are cleared." },
      { "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent or paid separately in Sector 133", "answer": "This varies significantly depending on the landlord’s preference and the building’s society rules. In many cases, the monthly maintenance fee for common area services like security, lift operation, and garbage collection is paid directly by the tenant to the Resident Welfare Association RWA. You must clarify if the advertised rent includes or excludes these charges before signing the lease agreement." },
      { "question": "What are the common lease duration options available for a Flat For Rent in Sector 133", "answer": "The most common lease duration is 11 months, which is renewable thereafter. Some landlords might agree to a 12-month lease. Longer-term leases, such as 24 months, are sometimes negotiable, especially for corporate rentals, often involving an agreed-upon annual rent escalation clause, typically around 5% to 10%." },
      { "question": "Can I find pet-friendly rental apartments in Sector 133 communities", "answer": "Finding a pet-friendly Flat For Rent in Sector 133 can be challenging, as many residential societies have restrictions or outright bans on pets, especially large breeds. However, certain societies are more accommodating. It is essential to explicitly confirm the society’s pet policy and get written confirmation from the landlord to avoid future disputes regarding your furry companions." },
      { "question": "How reliable is public transportation when living in Sector 133 Noida", "answer": "Public transportation reliability is excellent. Sector 133 is well-served by shared auto-rickshaws and app-based cab services due to its proximity to the Noida Expressway. While the nearest active Metro station might require a short drive, new Metro lines are planned for the area, which will significantly boost future connectivity and commuter convenience for residents." },
      { "question": "What is the typical notice period required for terminating a rental agreement here", "answer": "The standard notice period specified in most rental agreements in Sector 133 is one or two months.

Failure to adhere to the notice period might result in the forfeiture of a portion of the security deposit." },
      { "question": "Are utilities like electricity and water included in the monthly rental cost", "answer": "Generally, basic utilities are not included in the rent. Tenants are usually responsible for paying their own electricity consumption bills based on meter readings. Water charges, if not covered by a flat monthly RWA fee, are also typically the tenant’s responsibility. Ensure you understand how utility meters are read and billed." },
      { "question": "How do I ensure the flat for rent is genuinely listed and not a scam", "answer": "To avoid rental scams when looking for a Flat For Rent in Sector 133, always work with reputable real estate agencies like ours.
