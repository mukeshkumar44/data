      {
        "question": "How can Real Estate Agents help with property valuation in Sector 74",
        "answer": "Professional Real Estate Agents in Sector 74 utilize proprietary data and comparable sales analysis (Comps) from the last six months to determine an accurate market value for your property.

This expert valuation is essential for sellers to set a competitive asking price and for buyers to ensure they are not overpaying."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents should I verify through my agent before buying property in Sector 74",
        "answer": "Your agent must verify crucial documents including the original Allotment Letter, Builder-Buyer Agreement, Occupation Certificate OC, Completion Certificate CC, the chain of previous ownership documents, and ensure there are no existing mortgages or liens on the property. For resale flats, the agent will verify property tax receipts and society No Objection Certificates NOCs to ensure a clean title transfer."
