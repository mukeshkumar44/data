      },
      {
        "question": "How do Real Estate Agents in Sector 100 determine an accurate selling price",

Agents compare your property with similar units recently sold within the same society or adjacent societies in Sector 100, factoring in variables like floor level, interior condition, view premium, and specific apartment layout. They also consider current market demand and recent price trends to provide a strategic, realistic, and competitive listing price."

        "question": "Should I sign an exclusive agreement with a Real Estate Agent in Sector 100",
        "answer": "Signing an exclusive agreement is common, especially for sellers of premium properties. It motivates the agent to invest more resources, time, and marketing budget into selling your property quickly and at the best price, as they are guaranteed the commission.
