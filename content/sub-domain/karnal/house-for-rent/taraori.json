    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental agreement duration for a house in Taraori",
        "answer": "Most landlords offering a house for rent in Taraori prefer a standard lease term of 11 months. This is common practice across India as it avoids certain obligations and registration requirements associated with leases exceeding 12 months. However, long-term tenants can often negotiate subsequent renewals for another 11 months or discuss a 24-month agreement that requires formal registration at the local Sub-Registrar's Office in Karnal district."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for rental properties in Taraori",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit usually equates to two months' worth of rent. For premium independent houses or newly built villas, some landlords might ask for three months' rent as security. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided the tenant adheres to the lease terms and returns the property without significant damages beyond standard wear and tear."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the monthly rent price in Taraori",
        "answer": "Generally, no utility bills are included in the quoted monthly rental price for houses in Taraori. Tenants are typically responsible for paying their own electricity consumption, water charges if applicable beyond a fixed amount, and any internet or DTH services they utilize. Always clarify with the landlord whether water usage is metered or covered by a fixed monthly society charge."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between an independent house and a builder floor rental",
        "answer": "An independent house means you rent the entire structure, including ground floor, upper floors, and the roof area, providing maximum privacy. A builder floor, common near the main Taraori areas, is a separate residential unit on one floor of a structure built by a builder. Builder floors usually share a common gate and often utilities like a borewell, but each floor unit is rented out separately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I verify the authenticity of a rental listing in Taraori",
        "answer": "When using our platform, authenticity is guaranteed as we pre-verify property documents. If searching independently, always insist on seeing the original property ownership documents or the latest municipal tax receipts held by the landlord. Meet the landlord in person, and ideally, speak to existing neighbors to confirm the property's status before signing any agreement or paying an advance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in houses for rent in Taraori",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary greatly depending on the landlord and the type of property. Independent houses often have a higher likelihood of allowing pets compared to shared builder floors or flats. It is crucial to disclose having pets upfront. Some landlords who permit pets may request an additional non-refundable pet deposit to cover potential cleaning or damage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance responsibilities fall to the tenant in a rental house",
        "answer": "Typically, tenants are responsible for minor day-to-day maintenance, such as fixing lightbulbs, minor plumbing issues like drain blockages, and ensuring general cleanliness. Major structural repairs, electrical wiring faults, water motor issues, or external wall painting are usually the landlord's responsibility. The division of responsibility must be clearly outlined in the rental lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to rent a house in Taraori",
        "answer": "Prospective tenants usually need to provide identity proof like Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current employment or student status, and address proof. Landlords typically require photocopies of these documents for police verification purposes and for drafting the legal lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for a house in Taraori",
        "answer": "Yes, rental prices are often negotiable, especially if you commit to a longer lease period, offer a larger security deposit, or if the property has been vacant for a period of time. Negotiation power depends heavily on the current demand for that specific type of house for rent in Taraori and the season."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to rent a house near the Taraori Railway Station area",
        "answer": "The area near the Taraori Railway Station is generally considered safe and highly convenient for commuting. While safety levels are high, renters should look for houses that have adequate security measures such as secure boundary walls, good exterior lighting, and reliable main door locks, which is a standard expectation in this locality."
