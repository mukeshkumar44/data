    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a House For Rent in Sector 45 Karnal",
        "answer": "Generally, landlords in Sector 45 require a security deposit equivalent to two to three months' rent. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided the house is returned in good condition, minus normal wear and tear. It is crucial to read the lease agreement carefully regarding the terms of deposit refund and any deductions that might apply, such as professional cleaning fees or outstanding utility bills. We ensure these terms are clearly outlined before you commit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Sector 45",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among property owners in Sector 45. While independent houses are generally more flexible than apartment complexes, many landlords still require explicit permission. If pets are allowed, expect to pay an additional, non-refundable pet deposit or a slightly higher monthly rent. Always disclose your pet ownership upfront to avoid complications later in your tenancy. We can filter listings specifically based on pet-friendly criteria."
      },

You will usually be required to pay the bills monthly based on meter readings. It is advisable to take a photo of the meter readings upon move-in to establish an accurate starting point for your consumption records."
