    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit requirement for a rental house in Assandh",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in the Assandh rental market typically ranges from one to two months’ rent, depending on the type of property and the owner's policy. This amount is refundable at the end of the tenancy after deducting costs for any damages beyond normal wear and tear. We clearly specify the exact deposit amount on every listing so there are no surprises during the agreement phase."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lease duration for residential properties in Assandh",
        "answer": "Most residential rental agreements in Assandh are signed for an initial period of 11 months. This duration is advantageous for both parties as it avoids stamp duty and complex registration requirements associated with leases exceeding one year. Renewals are usually negotiated towards the end of the 11-month period, often with a standard rent escalation clause of 5% to 10%."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for property maintenance and repairs in a rented house",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is responsible for minor daily maintenance and repairs such as replacing light bulbs or fixing minor plumbing issues that occur due to negligence. However, major structural repairs, electrical issues, or major plumbing failures caused by standard wear and tear are the responsibility of the property owner. The lease agreement clearly outlines these responsibilities to prevent future disputes over repair costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I bring my pet when I rent a House For Rent in Assandh",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined on a case-by-case basis by individual property owners in Assandh. While some landlords are pet-friendly, others strictly prohibit animals. If you have pets, it is crucial to use our pet-friendly filter when searching and notify us immediately so we can confirm the policy and potentially negotiate terms, which may include a higher security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to finalize a rental agreement in Assandh",
        "answer": "To secure a House For Rent in Assandh, you will typically need copies of your Aadhar Card or other Government-issued photo ID, proof of current address, and potentially proof of employment or income stability. For foreign nationals, a valid passport and visa are mandatory. We facilitate the creation of the legally binding lease agreement after these documents are verified."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to break my lease early",
        "answer": "Breaking a lease prematurely usually incurs penalties as defined in the rental agreement. Standard clauses often require the tenant to forfeit the security deposit or pay a penalty equivalent to one or two months’ rent. We recommend carefully reviewing the notice period requirements, typically 30 to 60 days, before signing the lease to understand the implications of early termination."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the monthly rent in Assandh",
        "answer": "In almost all cases in Assandh, utility bills such as electricity, water, and gas charges are separate from the monthly rent and must be paid directly by the tenant. The rent covers only the occupation of the property. Tenants are usually required to transfer utility connections into their name or pay monthly bills based on meter readings provided by the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I schedule a viewing for a property I like",
        "answer": "Scheduling a viewing is simple. Once you find a House For Rent in Assandh that interests you on our platform, you can use the 'Schedule Viewing' button or contact our Assandh property advisor directly via phone or email. We will coordinate with the property owner to arrange a convenient time for you to inspect the home personally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a brokerage fee to rent a property through your service",
        "answer": "Our service structure is transparent regarding brokerage. Typically, the tenant pays a service charge equivalent to half a month's rent or one full month’s rent upon successful signing of the lease, depending on the property value and service package chosen. This covers the costs of verification, negotiation, and documentation preparation provided by our team."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to rent an independent house versus an apartment in Assandh",
        "answer": "Both independent houses and apartments in Assandh offer secure living, though their security features differ. Apartments often benefit from centralized security, guards, and CCTV in common areas. Independent houses rely on perimeter fencing and self-installed security systems. We only list properties in neighborhoods considered safe and well-connected regardless of the property type."
