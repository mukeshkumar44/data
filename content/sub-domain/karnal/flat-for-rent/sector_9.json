        "question": "What is the standard security deposit requirement for flats in Sector 9 Karnal",
        "answer": "Typically, landlords in Sector 9 require a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent.

For flats located within large gated society complexes, maintenance charges for common areas, security, and power backup are usually paid separately by the tenant to the RWA. For independent builder floors, these costs are generally handled directly by the tenant or occasionally negotiated to be included in the rent. Always clarify this point in the lease agreement."

Water charges are sometimes included in the maintenance fee for society flats, but for independent floors, they are often separate. Ensure the property has individual meters installed before signing the lease."
