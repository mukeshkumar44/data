    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What makes the Sadar Bazar property market unique compared to new sectors in Karnal",
        "answer": "Sadar Bazar is fundamentally a legacy commercial hub, meaning property values are driven less by amenities and more by location, foot traffic, and potential rental yield. Unlike the new sectors which offer modern infrastructure, Sadar Bazar provides historical connectivity and established business presence. Real Estate Agents here focus heavily on property vintage, FSI constraints, and existing tenancy rights which are not typical concerns in newer developments in Karnal."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do Real Estate Agents in Sadar Bazar determine the value of old properties",
        "answer": "Valuation in Sadar Bazar is complex and multifaceted. Agents use a comparative market analysis focusing on recent sales in the immediate vicinity but also heavily factor in the commercial viability of the ground floor space, the potential for vertical development, and the cost of necessary renovations or structural upgrades. They also assess the value based on projected commercial rental returns which are usually higher than average in this prime location."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sadar Bazar primarily for commercial or residential investment now",
        "answer": "Sadar Bazar is predominantly a commercial investment zone with mixed-use potential. While residential units exist, often above shops, the primary investment driver is retail and wholesale trade. Expert Real Estate Agents in Sadar Bazar can identify properties that offer the optimal blend of commercial revenue generation and residential convenience, catering to owner-occupiers who wish to live near their business."
      },
      {
        "question": "What legal challenges might arise when buying property through Real Estate Agents in Sadar Bazar",
        "answer": "Common legal challenges include unclear titles due to multi-generational ownership, old registered leases or tenancy agreements that need termination, and non-compliance with current municipal building codes. Working with a seasoned Real Estate Agent ensures that a thorough title search and verification of all municipal clearances are conducted, safeguarding the buyer from inheriting pre-existing legal disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I trust Real Estate Agents in Sadar Bazar with properties that are under litigation",
        "answer": "A highly professional and ethical Real Estate Agent will advise caution on properties under active litigation. However, they can assist in legally navigating pre-litigation status or properties where litigation has been resolved but documents need clearing. They act as a liaison with legal counsel, ensuring full transparency about the risks involved before any commitment is made."
