Clearly document all permissible modifications before signing the contract."

      {
        "question": "How do I ensure the Shop For Rent location has adequate parking facilities",
        "answer": "Parking is a critical factor for commercial success in Sector 45. When reviewing a listing confirm if dedicated or common parking spaces are allocated to the unit.

        "question": "What is the typical rent escalation clause in Sector 45 commercial leases",
        "answer": "Most commercial leases in Sector 45 include a rent escalation clause to account for inflation and market value growth. The most common escalation rate is between 5 percent and 10 percent applied annually or biennially. Negotiating a lower or staggered escalation rate can be a significant cost saving measure especially for longer-term leases so ensure this point is thoroughly reviewed before finalizing the agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are all types of businesses allowed in every Shop For Rent location",
        "answer": "No the permissible use of a Shop For Rent is governed by the building's zoning regulations and the local municipal corporation rules for Sector 45 Karnal.

We recommend thoroughly researching comparable properties in Sector 45 to justify your offer. Our team assists in presenting your business profile professionally to secure the best possible terms and often facilitates multiple rounds of negotiation on your behalf."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay stamp duty and registration fees for a commercial lease",
        "answer": "Yes commercial leases exceeding a certain duration typically 11 months must be registered with the sub-registrar office and require payment of applicable stamp duty and registration fees based on the lease value and duration. The cost is usually shared between the landlord and the tenant or handled as per the agreement. Proper registration provides legal validity and protection to both parties."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I occupy the shop after the lease agreement is signed",
        "answer": "Occupancy timelines depend on the shop's current condition and whether immediate possession is granted. If the shop requires minimal fit-outs and is vacant occupancy can be immediate upon signing and deposit payment. If extensive renovations are needed or if the unit is being vacated by a previous tenant the timeline could extend from 15 days to several months. Always confirm the exact handover date."
