    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for a commercial shop for rent in Gharaunda",
        "answer": "The most common commercial lease duration in Gharaunda is 11 months, which is frequently renewed to avoid mandatory registration requirements and associated stamp duty. However, for established businesses seeking long-term security or those investing heavily in interiors, 3-year or 5-year registered lease agreements are often negotiated. These longer terms usually include specific clauses detailing rent escalation percentage and maintenance responsibilities shared between the landlord and tenant."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are security deposits calculated for rental shops in Gharaunda",
        "answer": "Security deposits for commercial shops typically range from two to six months of the agreed-upon monthly rent, depending on the shop's location, size, and the financial standing of the tenant. Prime locations near the main highway or central market may demand a higher deposit. This deposit is refundable upon termination of the lease, provided all rental payments are current and no significant damage beyond normal wear and tear has occurred to the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is GST applicable on the rent paid for commercial properties in Gharaunda",
        "answer": "Yes, if the landlord is registered under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework and their total taxable turnover exceeds the specified threshold, GST is generally applicable on commercial property rent. The current rate is typically 18%. Tenants who are also GST-registered businesses may be eligible to claim this input tax credit, which is an important financial consideration when budgeting for total monthly commercial expenses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance of a rented shop in Gharaunda",
        "answer": "Maintenance responsibilities are clearly defined in the lease agreement. Generally, the tenant is responsible for minor internal repairs, upkeep of fixtures, and utility maintenance like air conditioning or plumbing blockages. The landlord typically remains responsible for structural repairs, major roof work, and external structural integrity of the property. Always clarify these responsibilities before signing to avoid disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do I need to rent a commercial shop as a business owner",
        "answer": "You will typically need several documents including proof of identity and address for the principal owners, GST registration certificate if applicable, proof of business registration (e.g., Udyam registration), bank statements for financial verification, and references. The landlord will require copies of these documents along with the signed and notarized lease agreement to finalize the shop rental process in Gharaunda."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the interior of the rental shop in Gharaunda for my business needs",
        "answer": "Interior modifications are usually allowed but require explicit written consent from the landlord, detailed within the lease agreement. Minor, non-structural changes like painting, shelving, or partition walls are often permitted. Major changes, especially those affecting structural components, electrical wiring, or plumbing, must be pre-approved. Tenants are often required to restore the property to its original condition upon vacating, unless otherwise agreed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is the frontage and parking availability for a rental shop in Gharaunda",
        "answer": "Frontage and parking are extremely important, particularly for retail and hospitality businesses in Gharaunda. Wide, visible frontage significantly increases customer attraction and branding opportunities. Adequate dedicated or common parking space is crucial to ensure customer convenience, especially near busy areas like the NH-44 access points, directly impacting foot traffic and sales volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common reasons for rent escalation in commercial leases",
        "answer": "Rent escalation typically occurs upon renewal of the lease agreement, usually annually or every three years. The increase is often tied to a pre-agreed percentage (e.g., 5% to 10% per annum) or benchmarked against prevailing market rates in Gharaunda's commercial sector. Clarity on the maximum escalation percentage protects tenants from unpredictable costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific legal requirements for signage placement on a rented shop",
        "answer": "Yes, local municipal bylaws in Gharaunda regulate the size, placement, and illumination of external signage. While tenants usually bear the cost and responsibility of their business signs, the landlord's written approval is mandatory. Ensure your proposed signage complies with local council rules regarding size limits and projection onto public pathways."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast can I finalize a shop rental agreement in the Gharaunda market",
        "answer": "The timeline can vary, but generally, once a property is selected, the legal and financial process takes between one week and one month. This includes background checks, deposit transfer, drafting the agreement, and necessary stamping or registration. Utilizing a professional real estate service like ours significantly speeds up the verification and negotiation phases."
