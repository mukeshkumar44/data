      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a shop for rent in Sector 28 Karnal",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial rentals in prime sectors like Sector 28 typically ranges from 12 to 36 months, depending heavily on the size of the shop and the specific fit-out requirements. Landlords often require a longer lock-in period for large anchor spaces due to the capital investment required for tenant improvements. We always work to negotiate the most favorable and flexible lock-in clause possible for our clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are maintenance charges usually structured for commercial properties here",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges in Sector 28 generally follow two structures. Either a fixed monthly charge is included in the rent covering common area lighting and security or a separate Common Area Maintenance CAM fee is charged based on the property's size. It is crucial to clarify what services are included in this fee, such as lift access, generator backup provision, and exterior upkeep, before finalizing the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize the lease agreement for a shop",
        "answer": "To finalize a commercial lease, you will typically need valid identification and address proof for all signatories, proof of business registration or incorporation documents, and GST registration details if applicable. Landlords also require recent bank statements or financial projections to assess the business's stability. Our team assists in compiling all necessary paperwork to ensure a smooth, legal transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there restrictions on the type of business I can open in Sector 28 shops",
        "answer": "While Sector 28 is primarily zoned for general commercial use, some restrictions may apply based on property bylaws or specific municipal zoning. High-hazard businesses, heavy industrial activities, or operations generating excessive noise might be restricted. Always confirm with us and the landlord that your proposed business activity is permitted under the property's existing commercial license before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors determine the rental price of a shop in Sector 28",
        "answer": "Rental prices are primarily influenced by four key factors the shop's floor level, its frontage width and visibility, the total usable area in square feet, and its proximity to major road intersections. Ground-floor corner units command the highest premiums due to maximum exposure. Age of the building and availability of parking also play secondary but significant roles in price determination."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate changes or renovations to the rented shop space",
        "answer": "Yes, major structural changes or extensive renovations usually require explicit written consent from the landlord and often necessitate approved municipal plans. Standard interior cosmetic changes like paint and non-structural partitions are typically permitted. All agreements should specify who bears the cost of these improvements and whether the fixtures must remain or be removed upon lease expiry."
      },
      {
        "question": "How far in advance should I start looking for a shop for rent in Sector 28",
        "answer": "Due to high demand for prime locations in Sector 28, it is highly recommended to start your search at least 3 to 6 months prior to your desired opening date.

        "answer": "Sector 28 is generally well-planned, and many commercial complexes offer dedicated basement or surface-level parking facilities for tenants and visitors. However, high-traffic areas might experience congestion during peak hours. Always confirm the availability of adequate, dedicated parking for your specific shop location to ensure customer convenience."
      },
