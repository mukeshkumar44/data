    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for renting a residential property in Assandh",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for residential rentals in Assandh generally ranges from one to three months worth of rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease provided the property is returned in good condition normal wear and tear excepted. Commercial properties might require a higher deposit, often spanning three to six months. We ensure this deposit is clearly documented in the rental agreement outlining the conditions for its return to protect both the tenant and the landlord effectively."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long are the standard lease periods for properties found through your Assandh to let service",
        "answer": "For residential properties, the most common lease term is 11 months, which is often renewed by mutual agreement between the parties. This term avoids stamp duty registration requirements that apply to leases exceeding one year. Commercial leases, especially for shops and offices in prime Assandh locations, are often structured for longer terms, such as three to five years, with stipulated annual rent escalations detailed in the contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility connections like electricity and water included in the rent price in Assandh",
        "answer": "In most rental properties in Assandh, utility charges like electricity, water, and gas are the responsibility of the tenant and are billed separately based on consumption. The rent covers the cost of using the property itself. However, certain apartment complexes or shared living spaces might include common area maintenance or water charges within the monthly rent. We clarify exactly which utilities are excluded or included before you sign the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance responsibilities fall to the tenant versus the landlord in Assandh rentals",
        "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing system failures, electrical wiring issues, and exterior maintenance. The tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs, upkeep, and general cleanliness, such as changing light bulbs, clearing drains, and ensuring proper use of fixtures. Specific responsibilities are always clearly defined in the rental deed to prevent ambiguities regarding repair costs and timelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for properties listed through your to let service in Assandh",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is a common part of the rental process in Assandh. Our agents are skilled negotiators who work to secure the best possible rental rate for you while respecting the landlord's market expectations. The potential for negotiation often depends on the property's demand, the current market trends, and the length of the lease you are willing to commit to upfront."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a local guarantor to rent a property in Assandh Karnal",
        "answer": "While not always mandatory, having a local guarantor, especially for students or individuals with less stable employment history, can significantly speed up the rental approval process. Landlords often prefer an added layer of security. We can advise you on whether a specific landlord requires a guarantor based on their screening policies for properties in the Assandh area."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rented property once the agreement is finalized",
        "answer": "Once the rental agreement is signed, the security deposit and first month's rent are paid, and any necessary property preparation is complete, move-in can typically occur within 3 to 7 days. This timeframe allows for the transfer of utilities if required and the final handover of keys. Our team works efficiently to expedite the process wherever possible for urgent occupancy requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required from tenants to secure a rental property in Assandh",
        "answer": "Required documentation typically includes proof of identity (Aadhaar Card, Passport), proof of current address, proof of employment or student status, and bank statements or salary slips to confirm financial stability. For commercial rentals, business registration documents are also required. We assist in compiling and verifying all necessary paperwork for a smooth application process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is subletting allowed for properties rented through your Assandh to let service",
        "answer": "Subletting policies are determined by the property owner and must be explicitly stated in the rental agreement. Generally, subletting is not permitted unless written consent is obtained from the landlord. Unauthorized subletting is a breach of the lease contract and can lead to eviction. We advise all tenants to fully understand the subletting clause before committing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What support is offered to landlords listing their property for rent in Assandh",
