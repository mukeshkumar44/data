        "answer": "Our listings include a perfect mix of all options to cater to diverse tenant needs and budgets. We clearly specify whether a property is fully furnished, semi-furnished, or completely unfurnished in its detailed description. Fully furnished apartments are ideal for short-term stays or those relocating without their belongings. Semi-furnished options usually include essential fixtures like cabinets, geysers, and lighting, while unfurnished properties allow tenants complete freedom to decorate and equip the space exactly as they wish."

      {
        "question": "What typically determines the amount required for a security deposit in Gharaunda rentals",
        "answer": "The standard practice in Gharaunda for residential properties is typically a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. However, this figure can sometimes be negotiated down to one month's rent or extended up to three months, particularly for premium or high-demand properties requiring greater security assurance. Commercial properties often require a slightly higher deposit, sometimes spanning three to six months rent, depending on the specifics of the lease terms and any structural fit-out requirements."

      {
        "question": "How do Gharaunda rental prices compare between areas near NH 44 and inner residential colonies",
        "answer": "Properties located directly along the highly strategic NH 44 commercial corridor, particularly commercial shops and modern flats, naturally command higher rental rates due to superior highway connectivity, visibility, and commercial traffic flow. Inner residential colonies like Shiv Colony or Bank Colony offer slightly lower and generally more stable rental prices, appealing strongly to long-term family residents seeking quieter environments, stronger community ties, and lower noise pollution away from major arteries."
