      },
      {
        "question": "How does traffic and congestion affect property accessibility in Sadar Bazar",
        "answer": "Sadar Bazar is known for high congestion, which is a sign of intense commercial activity. However, many areas have specific hours designated for goods loading and unloading, and municipal planning is continuously working to improve access routes for light commercial vehicles. Properties located closer to major entry points or those with dedicated loading bays command a premium due to simplified logistics operations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical appreciation rate for commercial real estate in Sadar Bazar annually",
        "answer": "While appreciation rates fluctuate with the general economy, properties in core Sadar Bazar consistently show robust capital appreciation, typically averaging 8% to 12% per annum over a 5-10 year horizon. This stability is driven by the severe scarcity of land and the ongoing expansion of wholesale trade activity that continuously pushes rental values and sale prices upward."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific zoning restrictions to consider when buying a shop in Sadar Bazar",
        "answer": "Zoning is critical in Sadar Bazar. Most properties are classified for commercial wholesale use.

We conduct thorough due diligence to verify that the property’s current use aligns perfectly with its legally permissible classification, preventing future operational issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance responsibilities usually fall on the owner versus the tenant in commercial leases",
        "answer": "Standard commercial leases in Sadar Bazar often operate under a 'Triple Net' (NNN) lease structure, where the tenant assumes responsibility for property taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (CAM) charges, relieving the owner of routine upkeep burdens. However, the property owner typically remains responsible for structural repairs and major capital expenditures."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for viewing commercial properties in such a busy location",
